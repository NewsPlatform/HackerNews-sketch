One can allocated a memory from kernel and send it as msg to user space and use it there without copy.   The limitation is that the max allows messages are statically pre-allocated for the system.     The library manages the pre-allocated pools of various sizes with lockless APIs.  When the pools runs out, the API returns error.<p>The only primitive the library depended on was Atomic_Inc&#x2F;Dec - absolutely no mutex, spin locks in the non-blocking API code path, etc.<p>The library was designed to support HA (High available ) TCP&#x2F;IP stack and routing protocols.      The APIs was not the complex.  The most complicate part was the regress testing code and the diagnostic code.    The API was used by team of 100+ developers.  I need help them to debug complex IPC&#x2F;DIPC issues - and prove to them when the error return, it was not the library&#x2F;API issue.<p>There was a trace mechanism that track all the messages went thru the system(s).   The trace system was also completely non-blocking and lockless, worked both in kernel and user space.   All context switches in Linux Kernel was tracked - very similar to FTRACE in kernel today.  I hacked the kernel&#x2F;bios to preserve the DRAM content part of the trace system during warmboot.   This way, I can recovered all the messages, last context switched info even for kernel hang, crash issue for postmortem.   The trace system used rdtsc for time stamping had 0.5 nano-seconds resolution on 2Ghz Xeon CPU.<p>The API&#x2F;Library worked fine.  The overall system complexities was a big issue.  We can demo TCP&#x2F;IP, BGP and various routing protocols that did HA Switch over and In Service OS upgrade.   But only as demo - and  after switch over the state syncing took a long time and reliability of HA TCP&#x2F;IP and routing protocol was an big issue.<p>Base on the lesson learned from that project - I went on and coded a different Application level HA system.  That system based everything on top of standard Linux API&#x2F;utilities.   That works much better and the HA port of the SW took only 1 dev (me) 3 weeks to code.   It supported in service  SW (include Linux kernel) upgrade, HW&#x2F;SW fault detected and automatically switch over.       It was deployed in Comcast.    Fault detection took &lt; 50 ms and switch over is almost instance.    Full state sync was done with wget over management Ethernet interface and always took &lt; 1 second.   All incremental states update were done over UDP and took 1 pkt.<p>The funny Biz&#x2F;$ outcomes from these two projects:<p>The first one: startup sold only one HA router for $200k and burned 100M+ of VC $ but sold to Nokia for $400+Mil.    I was able to paid off my mortgage with the options from that company - Not FU money but ok outcome.<p>The 2nd one: The startup sold $40M of products for $60K from that project to Comcast and various Cable companies at 60% margin.  That product (with 19+ FPGA) was created&#x2F;code&#x2F;developed with ~8 HW&#x2F;FW&#x2F;SW engineers (including the 2  founders).    The VC got &quot;a seasoned CEO&quot; - managed to raise a few more rounds, kick out the founders (MIT PhD), hired 160+ people and ran the company to the ground.","time":1509639969,"type":"comment"}

Caches are fully coherent so they never enter into the window in any lock-free algorithms.<p>Perhaps &quot;Cache Flush&quot; is the wrong word, but as long as cores are forced to communicate, you&#x27;re going to get a performance penalty.<p>I know when you do a simple atomic_increment on x86_64 platforms, things can be 2x slower at a minimum than a non-atomic increment.<p>&quot;Cache Coherence&quot; simply means that the CPU handles all of those edge cases for you. But it still needs to be handled, and that entails a performance penalty.<p>If you have a 4-core &#x2F; 8-thread machine (Like a recent Intel i7), its faster to have 8-Non Atomic counters that are added up at the end... rather than to have 1-atomic counter with 8-threads doing atomic-increment on it.<p>----------------<p>Any core that modifies a memory location invalidates the cache for all other cores. (ie: Core 1 does atomic_inc(x), implies that Core2&#x2F;Core3&#x2F;Core4 all have an invalid value of &quot;x&quot;. So atomic_inc(x) causes a cache-flush on Core2&#x2F;Core3&#x2F;Core4)<p>Again, I&#x27;m not an expert, but that&#x27;s my understanding of how modern systems work.<p>-------<p>I looked up the Intel Architecture Manual, and they have the following table:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;uesh8co\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;uesh8co</a><p>If the data is in another core&#x27;s L1 cache, the latency increases dramatically, especially on a &quot;Dirty  Hit&quot;. (ie: Core1 is trying to read &quot;x&quot;, but Core3 is telling the other cores that &quot;x&quot; has changed)<p>In effect, its more efficient for an Intel CPU to access something from L3 cache than for it to access a &quot;Dirty&quot; value from another core.

The problem would be to make updates as small as possible and also to not use prohibitive amount of CPU time.<p>I don&#x27;t have any monetization in mind as you probably should have guessed at this point. Probably if it would be frugal enough it could run from my pocket and hopefully some donations.<p>However I’m almost totally green in this area. I started a bit with learning how to index and search with SQLite&#x27;s FTS5. I don&#x27;t like dependencies too much and would like to keep the local version option available. So probably typical ElasticSearch and other Java apps are probably too heavy. You can safely ignore technical side of my comment if you know better. If someone is more capable to do this than me, please make it instead of me ;)","time":1509661327,"type":"comment"}

I, too, have been meditating over this matter a lot.<p>Unfortunately, though, it seems to me that people generally adopt one of the 3 camps:\n* Don&#x27;t care (that is, most users until their internet slows)\n* Business of humanity is business. Anyone disagrees with the previous sentence is socialist&#x2F;communist&#x2F;hippie&#x2F;devil-spawn.\n* &quot;GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH.&quot; Ready to leave Google&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;AWS at moment notice.<p>I mean, it&#x27;s important to know what bad large firms have brought forth with the internet. But it&#x27;s equally important to acknowledge what they (and commerce in general) have enabled, as well as what advantages they possess to users in everyday life.<p>To take a simple example: the article ends with a question: &quot;Do we want the web to be open, accessible, empowering and collaborative? [...] Or do we want it to be just another means of endless consumption[...]?&quot;\nLook, about 80% of the time, I do want mindless consumption. Maybe a stupid sitcom on one of the streaming service; maybe some cheesy pop over YouTube. I need that. And, you know what, the current arrangement is damned good at deliver that kind of consumption.<p>Thus, condemning the status quo wholesale is either useless or extremely risky. Look, the status quo is status quo for a reason. How did Amazon get so big? Not because they send out goons to smash windows of local bookstores! They get big because they provide genuine value (large selection, stellar customer service, fast shipping, etc.). Google got so big because they are very <i>very</i> good with organization of information and extremely good with matching customers and advertisement. Apple got so big because they produce(d) beautiful products. Facebook got so big because they connect people together. Uber got so big because they make taxi-ing so convenient (and cheap). These businesses got there for good reasons.<p>Except the case where you find way to provide the same (or at the minimum almost the same) value with free and open ecosystem, status quo remains. Sure, you can host your own fonts and pictures and videos, but then they will be served from <i>your</i> hosts. Have you invested billions of dollars in gateway to be near your customers? Have you invested many hundreds of engineering-years to test over as many browsers as you can find? And remember, you are probably a power user of the internet. How about everyone else? Does everyone need to learn how to administrate GNU&#x2F;Linux to post views of the world?<p>Without providing the same value, revolutions tend to fall short of their promises. Take American Revolution. They proclaimed &quot;All Men are created equal,&quot; killed a bunch of people (many innocent), then proceeded to keep slavery anyway. And that&#x27;s one of the most successful revolutions. French Revolution produced an emperor to replace a king. English Revolutionary failed. Paris Commune failed. Russian and Chinese Revolutions were followed by famines. And so on.<p>Imagine the internet without Google, Facebook, and AWS. You know what will happen next? Somebody else will become Google, Facebook, and AWS. Look at China: sure, they are independent from Google and Facebook; and they have Baidu and Weibo. Google, Facebook, Amazon, AWS serve important needs. You can&#x27;t not have someone like them.<p>In other words: all of these protests are useless and&#x2F;or harmful without careful consideration of the underlining economics and usage. And I am not sure if anyone has gotten around to figure out an economic model for free web yet.","time":1509661699,"type":"comment"}

Robert would have felt this had the controls been connected, since he was attempting to control the plane at that time.

The pilot put the system into a backup dumb mode while in cruise, then changed stations to where he could best see the dock while still in the wrong mode. Rammed the dock at 12 knots. 79 injured, 4 seriously.<p>This is bad design. All the controls that can steer the ship should be tied together and move together.  How to do that was figured out decades ago.<p>The Navy still has this thing where they hate to give control of both speed and steering to the same person.  The helmsman and engine room take orders from the officer that has the conn. But that officer doesn&#x27;t actually operate the controls.  Some enlisted sailors do. This dates from the age of sail and steam. Merchant shipping gave this up decades ago.<p>Back in the 1950s, the U.S. Navy built the USS Albacore. This was an experimental submarine to test out the teardrop-hull concept.  It wasn&#x27;t nuclear; it was just a test vehicle to see how such a hull form handled.  It was expected to be more maneuverable than previous designs, so it was set up with aircraft-like controls. One person sat in the pilot&#x27;s seat, strapped in facing forward, looking at aircraft-type instruments, and controlled all the maneuvering controls.  It was a very agile craft.<p>The brass hated it. The person in the pilot&#x27;s seat was really the one in charge.  The officers were just back-seat drivers. To this day, the Navy sets up nuclear submarines so that different people steer, control power, and control buoyancy.<p>(The British in WWII tried to control aircraft with multiple people. As bombers got bigger, they wanted to put a senior officer in charge, but younger people were better pilots. So they had an &quot;aircraft commander&quot; back-seat driving, as well as a pilot handling the controls. This did not work out at all and was rapidly dropped.)<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ntsb.gov&#x2F;news&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;Pages&#x2F;PR20140408c.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ntsb.gov&#x2F;news&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;Pages&#x2F;PR20140408c.a...</a>","time":1509667444,"type":"comment"}

No friendly GUI, but the underlying systems are the same.  The flaw with any sort of safety net is that you get used to it and forget the basics of aviation.<p>The big problem was that the pilot-in-command simply forgot (or did not know) how to fly the plane.  He overcorrected in reaction to turbulence and the rest is history.  Normal law does not allow the pilot to set an angle of attack that would lead to a stall.  In the alternate law modes this protection is not there and so when the PIC didn&#x27;t adhere to the rule of &quot;don&#x27;t pull up while in a stall&quot; there was no safety net to prevent him from exacerbating the situation.  In fact he kept pulling back when the stall alarm went off.<p>A better UI would not have solved the self-inflicted problems.  From the findings sections in the wiki entry:<p>- The pilots apparently did not notice that the aircraft had reached its maximum permissible altitude<p>- The pilots did not read out the available data (vertical velocity, altitude, etc.)<p>- the crew made inappropriate control inputs that destabilized the flight path;<p>- the crew failed to follow appropriate procedure for loss of displayed airspeed information;<p>- the crew lacked understanding of the approach to stall<p>- the crew lacked practical training in manually handling the aircraft both at high altitude and in the event of anomalies of speed indication<p>- the two co-pilots&#x27; task sharing was weakened both by incomprehension of the situation at the time of autopilot disconnection, and by poor management of the &quot;startle effect&quot;, leaving them in an emotionally charged situation<p>- the crew did not respond to the stall warning<p>A better cockpit may have given the pilots a better chance of surviving but definitely wouldn&#x27;t have guaranteed a better outcome.  One only needs to look at Asiana to see that even Boeing, with their contrasting approach to UX, can&#x27;t save pilots who lack basic airmanship.  My understanding is that most long-haul pilots will fly a fairly small number of segments each month, and that most of those segments are going to involve a huge amount of time spent in the middle of nowhere with autopilot on.  This leads to atrophying of skills needed to manually fly a plane.<p>Conversely, one only need to look at Qantas&#x27; QF32 incident to see that good airmanship can absolutely make catastrophic failure survivable.  Yes, there is a lot of information to process in an emergency... but the Qantas crew took that information and delegated appropriately.  The Air France pilots lost their cool and fucked up.","time":1509668752,"type":"comment"}

This is a very good thing.<p>The issue is that technologists insist on making a clear distinction between the “user” and the “developer”. If you hide the number of web requests away in an obscure, borderline illegible, “developer tools” pane, is it a surprise that the average user has no idea about what is going on in their browser? No one is interested about building a browser, or even an operating system for that matter, that focuses on making things understandable, learnable. That is part of the reason why we end up in situations like the ones described in the article.<p>Regarding differences in intelligence, that is not a particularly relevant point here. People have differences (plural) in intelligences (plural). Even one person has diffferences in intelligences throughout their life at many different scales - I was much better at physics back in college than I am now because I practiced it more, and yet I wouldn’t say I was more intelligent 10 years ago than I am now even though I could solve physics problems faster. There are even pretty big fluctuations in my intelligence in a single day based on how tired&#x2F;frustrated I am, if I have concerns at the back of my mind, etc. All of these statements aren’t really relevant here, because we have systems that deliberately obfuscate how they work, which is a much bigger problem.","time":1509671377,"type":"comment"}

However, I can see how the media has portrayed Trump voters, and it doesn&#x27;t take a rocket scientist to realise that the media portrayal is missing the wood for the trees. The main options commonly given for why people voted for Trump is that either they were manipulated by the media or they share some of Trump&#x27;s negative personality traits.<p>However, if you look at polls about what people care about in an election, the same thing comes out top time and time again. The economy. It seems that many people don&#x27;t follow politics that closely, but what they do understand is that it has an impact on the economy, and they care about jobs.<p>So let&#x27;s look at this from a purely economic perspective. When faced with a choice between Trump and Clinton, putting personality aside, are there any economic reasons why someone might have chosen Trump over Clinton?<p>The main message I hope to get across is that if the media you consume is conveniently packaging a set of memes about a subject, you can be almost certain they&#x27;re missing out on details. Real life is messy and chaotic, boiling down the motives of the general population to easy to consume soundbites is unlikely to accurately capture the thoughts of hundreds of millions of people. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s useful to look beyond the headlines, and look to understand those you disagree with. Partisan biases weaken the health of public discourse.

In that time it has gone through two major glass cockpit avionics revisions.  In the first revision, called the Avidyne, the autopilot was either on or off.  In the current revision, called the G-1000, the autopilot can operate in two modes: AP mode, where the autopilot is actually flying the plane, and FD or flight-director mode, where the autopilot does all of the calculations to figure out where the plane should be flying and displays a target on the primary flight display, but the actual control of the plane is still in the hands of the pilot.<p>If the plane is stable, it is <i>very</i> easy to get fooled into thinking the autopilot is flying the plane when in fact it is not.

You didn&#x27;t need to look at it to figure out how to push the radio button, turn the volume, anything. You could even adjust the bass on the fly with a bass knob instead of navigating to your &quot;eq&quot; menu to do it.<p>Now, you&#x27;ve got to look away from the road, realize what &quot;mode&quot; your in, you can move the menu around to the &quot;audio&quot; section, then &quot;fm&quot;, then select a channel. And of course, it&#x27;s a touch screen so there&#x27;s no tactile feedback.

So you may start the car and have 5-10 seconds of blasting radio that you can do nothing about. GREAT JOB GUYS. A volume knob that needs to boot.<p>This is what was considered not only acceptable, but a &quot;Feature&quot; in a modern vehicle with hundreds of millions of dollars in investment and NOBODY thought to see if the radio interface was actually... efficient? It&#x27;s not like people interact with the radio&#x2F;music console in a car on a regular basis...<p>Or my 2001 Jetta. It was one of the earlier cars with &quot;climate control&quot;. What that actually means is that to set it to heat, you have to tap the &quot;plus temp&quot; button a literal 20-30 times to get it into &quot;HI&quot; to force heat on. And then the day warms up and on your drive home you want AC? Tap it 20-30 times on the &quot;minus temp&quot; button. There was no knob for AC temp. They gave you 1 degree precision on a car that couldn&#x27;t guarantee 10 degree temperatures. Additionally, the volume control for the car had digital buttons. That&#x27;s right. Enjoy pressing up&#x2F;down 50 times. No ability to rapidly change volume. So when you switch radio stations or to casette&#x2F;cd and the volume is highly different you have to sit there pressing the button over and over. But, even then, at least these were BUTTONS that you didn&#x27;t have to look away from the road to use.

The aforementioned &quot;architects of the web&quot; are just there to create content but they&#x27;re not the ones that need to load it up with tracking codes, tag managers, and DRM. The people that monetized the web are the ones that broke it.<p>2) The culture of the internet is completely different now and I think it&#x27;s because the barrier of entry for the internet is so low now. Consider that, up until a few years ago (5-10 maybe, or longer?), it took some amount of knowledge and&#x2F;or skill to use the internet. Everyone couldn&#x27;t just jump on the web. You had to know enough about how to use a computer to install the software, you had to be educated enough to connect the hardware and install drivers, and you had to know how to find information. Even more so, if you wanted to <i>contribute</i> to the web, you needed to know some kind of programming language and at least basic HTML, how to get those pages on to a server, and how to connect it all to a domain. It wasn&#x27;t all just a Google search away from whatever word-vomit is advertised the most and pushed up to the front via SEO and Facebook&#x2F;social media. Now, anyone can get on the internet. Almost every person on the planet has some access to the web and adding to the bucket of knowledge and data on the web is done via WYSIWYG editors and text comment boxes that require nothing more than the ability to use a keyboard. YouTube comments and Facebook comments are complete shit for the very reason that it doesn&#x27;t take any amount of effort to post them.<p>3) Intellectual property on the internet is a mess and, as the article has pointed out, everything is starting to centralize instead of the decentralized web of the past. There is <i>severe</i> bit-rot that happens that didn&#x27;t happen before simply due to the fact that a YouTube video can now be automatically taken down, without cause, over even the suspicion or false claim that it contains copyrighted content. The amount of content that has disappeared off the internet because of a DMCA takedown is heartbreaking, especially when you consider that a lot of other content embeds it or references it. The web&#x27;s greatest feature, the hyperlink, is now its biggest downfall because corporations and greedy assholes can take down content just by accusing it of violating copyrights. They don&#x27;t even have to own it to make a claim. In other words, the ability to rot that content is far easier and more automated than the ability to protect that content. Politicians the world over have done their part to sell us all out and reinforce this negative cycle instead of protecting the backbone of the internet.<p>All in all, the internet used to be about sharing information. Now it&#x27;s about cashing in on everything possible and, to the author&#x27;s credit, he&#x27;s at least identified that commoditization is a huge part of that problem. It&#x27;s not the only problem, though. Tracking is a symptom, not the cause.","time":1509676140,"type":"comment"}

In that case the Egyptian investigative body was thought to be politically motivated.<p>Similarly, it&#x27;s not at all implausible that the French BEA would be reluctant to make conclusions that could result in the grounding of the entire worldwide Airbus fleet while they&#x27;re retrofitted with Boeing-style controls while France is the main Airbus manufacturing partner country.<p>1. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Air_France_Flight_447#Independent_analyses\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Air_France_Flight_447#Independ...</a><p>2. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Air_France_Flight_447#Sidestick_control\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Air_France_Flight_447#Sidestic...</a><p>3. <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;EgyptAir_Flight_990\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;EgyptAir_Flight_990</a>","time":1509698879,"type":"comment"}

The fact that the PNF never managed to integrate these three very basic pieces of information makes it seem rather unlikely that he would have paid close attention to the position of his (hypothetically linked) control stick.<p>Note that when the PNF took over the controls briefly, he made a lateral input rather than pushing the stick forward!

I think I might agree with the implication that a system should make doing cognitively difficult&#x2F;safety critical things easy but there is no possible way to plan for all eventualities, that&#x27;s why we have &#x27;intelligent&#x27; controllers in ultimate charge.<p>One day we might have artificial intelligence in charge but we&#x27;re not there yet.<p>So instead of the goal of good UX being the designer planning out what is good and bad, it is much better to design a system that reduces cognitive load but presents information about the current state of the system in the most obvious and intuitive way possible. It should do everything it can to make sure the operator understands the current state of the system.<p>In terms of operating complex physical systems like ships and aircraft the ultimate goal of designing control systems is to simultaneously take as much of the burden off the operator as possible but present all information needed in order to bring the system back to an _understood_ state as rapidly as possible following deviation from that state. This is the only way to maintain _control_.<p>It&#x27;s reasonable to try and make it difficult to get to a state that is &#x27;uncontrolled&#x27;. But it&#x27;s imperative that more credence is given to getting a system back to an understood state once the controller finds them self in one that&#x27;s not understood. It may get to this state in a way the designer didn&#x27;t plan for, so getting out of it has to be incredibly quick and easy.<p>Personally, I put more stock in getting the system in an understood state than a controlled one as from there it&#x27;s easier to return to control.

For example, if you push the stick forward and then let it return to the center, the plane will pitch down, and remain in that attitude until the stick is pushed again.

He&#x27;s expressing an opinion about the sidesticks that many other professional pilots disagree with (see e.g. the endless forum discussions on pprune). You can find pilots who support all kinds of wacky theories of various accidents. Sullenberger has a high profile (deservedly), and can get on TV.<p>The fundamental issues with Sullenberger&#x27;s claim that the accident would be much less likely in an aircraft with conventional controls are (i) that there have been multiple crashes in such aircraft caused by unrecovered recoverable stalls (e.g. Colgan 3407, Turkish 1951) and (ii) that there is pretty good evidence from the transcript that the PNF was aware of the PFs inputs in any case.

This would imply that the heat generation and turbine spin-up time merely need to respond before the batteries are discharged, potentially allowing response times of minutes or hours. It would give Tesla-like instant throttle response, where the operator would move the lever and the sub would jump forward.<p>Or does it directly power the engines? This would mean that your entire control loop would include the latency of the steam generation process.  Move the lever, wait for the water to get hot, wait for the turbines to spin up, and then the screws would start to turn faster. Like the throttle response in an ancient diesel truck.<p>Given that the original diesel submarines used giant battery arrays to power the electric motors while the engines were off, and that the former gives much better control response, I&#x27;d assume that there are still large batteries in the loop. This paper [2] supports that assertion:<p>&gt; <i>The nominal cell voltage is 2.0 V.

Unfortunately, the stupid system made that mistake pretty easy, too. Instead of telling the operators at the Vincennes if the approaching plane was ascending or descending, the system just showed them the present altitude on a smaller monitor. The operator had to write down or memorize the altitude, wait a few seconds, then ask again and mentally compare the two results to see if the aircraft was going up or going down.<p>&gt; Because of this, a calculation error led an operator to report that the Airbus was descending toward the USS Vincennes, like a combat aircraft would, when it was probably getting the hell away from them as fast as possible.","time":1509717809,"type":"comment"}

The BEA report explicitly blames the <i>lack</i> of an AoA display and recommends that an AoA indicator be directly visible to the pilots. The aircraft already has sensors to measure AoA to feed the flight computers; asking for a direct readout of AoA is nothing beyond a UI change recommendation (and not fundamental aircraft re-engineering):<p>&gt; It is essential in order to ensure flight safety to reduce the angle of attack when a stall is imminent. Only a direct readout of the angle of attack could enable crews to rapidly identify the aerodynamic situation of the aeroplane and take the actions that may be required.<p>The AoA invalidation logic (&quot;mark AoA measurements as invalid if airspeed is less than 60kt&quot;) made the stall warning turn <i>off</i> as the stall became even deeper, making diagnosis of the stall more complicated. Worse, the BEA report states that the appropriate (nose down) control input led to the stall warning reactivating (since such an input would increase airspeed above the 60kt threshold -- inherent to a proper stall recovery), leading the pilot flying to <i>reverse</i> their control inputs and return the aircraft <i>into a worse stall</i>:<p>&gt; A few seconds after the transition to alternate law, the stall warning sounded briefly, even though the PF’s inputs should have made this warning sound for several seconds. The reason for this is the drop in the measured airspeeds, some of which fell temporarily to below 60 kt, while the angle of attack reached 40°. Furthermore, the drop in measured airspeeds to values of less than 60 kt during the stall caused the repeated activation and deactivation of the warning which may have made it considerably more difficult for the Captain to effectively analyse the situation on his return to the cockpit.<p>&gt; Several nose-down inputs caused a drop in the pitch attitude and the angle of attack, whose values then became valid, such that a clear nose-down input resulted in the triggering of the stall warning. It appears that the PF reacted, on at least two occasions, with a nose-up input, whose consequences were an increase in angle of attack, a drop in measured speed and consequently stopping the stall warning.<p>Lacking an AoA readout, the pilots would have had to reverse-engineer AoA from their extant instrument displays, the warnings they were presented, the &quot;feel&quot; of the airplane (is it buffeting? how is it responding to various control inputs?, etc), and past control inputs. Every one of those sources were degraded per the BEA report: they didn&#x27;t trust (to the point of changing the selected <i>inertial</i> data source even if there was no indicated issue with inertial data) their instruments because of the airspeed inconsistency, the stall warning would reactivate every time they made the correct control input (the exact opposite behaviour of a stall warning simply based on an AoA threshold), and buffet might have been interpreted as overspeed buffet.<p>Expecting pilots to reverse-engineer the aircraft&#x27;s warnings to guesstimate AoA -- a value that the machinery simultaneously <i>measures</i> and <i>hides</i> from the pilots -- is fatally bad UI (BEA uses the fancier term &quot;ergonomics&quot;), <i>especially</i> in cases when the flight computers deal with air data inconsistencies by forking over more authority to the pilots.","time":1509717902,"type":"comment"}

Most hackers still think of “end-user” as you and me (note the answers you’re getting), and this is why Free Software is losing battles left and right, particularly in mobile. Stallman’s comments re: iPhone, for example, demonstrate that as an industry and advocacy group we still don’t <i>really</i> understand this.<p>We have to accept that those who <i>need</i> rigid, inflexible computing to protect them far outnumber us. People don’t care if they can rewrite Notepad or read its source code, they care that Facebook works and that they don’t get viruses or added to a botnet. The <i>only</i> way to develop a healthy advocacy here is to understand that the hacker ideals and customizability that we expect of a computing system really make us a vanishing minority and acknowledging that for the now-average user, those ideals make less and less sense as time goes on. We had our run, then everybody else found computers. Times change. It’s not bad.<p>Is there a way to create your computer? For us, probably. For them, I’m increasingly believing it isn’t.

Proprietary operating systems, walled gardens, Internet centralization, it plays toward all of the ideals Free Software has been holding dear for decades. We have to evolve our thinking, I’m afraid.

My understanding is that the current OOD already has a trajectory planned through the workspace coordinate system (space, time) and gives orders in workspace coordinates (&quot;go this fast&quot;) that are then translated into low-level control outputs (&quot;set the rudder to X&quot;). It sounds like in some cases the OOD even gives direct control outputs - &quot;Prepare for X thrust in Y minutes&quot;. Certainly these low-level controllers can&#x27;t be a good thing for the OOD to be spending cognitive resources on, and I&#x27;d be <i>astounded</i> if we can&#x27;t replace that with a computer that translates directly from that trajectory to the control outputs.<p>That&#x27;s why I used airplanes as my example, rather than, say, autonomous vehicles. A commercial airliner&#x27;s path through the air to a safe landing is basically hard-coded. The task of the airplane&#x27;s autopilot, then, is simply to follow that trajectory - and I&#x27;d guess that it&#x27;s <i>far</i> more difficult for an airliner to follow a workspace trajectory than it is for a ship to do so.<p>Really, the hard part is going to be getting the trajectory out of the OOD&#x27;s head. And even then, it&#x27;d be <i>so much easier</i> if the helmsman could execute &quot;go this way&quot; by punching &quot;this way&quot; into a computer instead of staring at a compass and directly and continuously controlling the rudder.","time":1509732057,"type":"comment"}

He <i>still</i> didn&#x27;t have a clue that the plane was stalled, even though this could easily have been figured out from the absolutely crazy combination of attitude, throttle setting, and rate of descent. It&#x27;s the <i>captain</i> who&#x27;s surprised by the stick being held back, not Robert. In fact, earlier portions of the trascript suggest that Robert was keeping track, more or less, of what the pilot was doing.<p>The captain entered when, according to the report, the plane was at about ~30,000 feet with a 40 degree angle of attack. The report states that &quot;up until the end of the flight, no valid angle of attack value was less than 35°&quot;. It seems, then, that even once everyone was aware of what the PF was doing, a correct stall recovery procedure was still not initiated. Or perhaps the stall was already unrecoverable -- I don&#x27;t know if airliners are designed to recover from such extreme configurations.<p>So, could linked sticks conceivably have helped before the captain entered? Probably not, because there is no evidence that Robert would have recognized that the stick inputs were inapporpriate, given that he was focusing on the ECAM warnings and appeared unable to grasp the implications of the readings from his primary flight instruments. Could linked sticks have helped after the captain entered? At that point, it was just a question of whether either pilot would take control and push the nose down.

You could just install it the regular way - when you do this postgres uses certain things by default like the port 5432.<p>Now you&#x27;re going to install a different piece of software on the machine, but this software also uses port 5432 by default and there&#x27;s an error about the port already being in use.  This is a pain, now you have to change the default port.  It turns out these conflicts are happening for a lot of things on the machine and it&#x27;s a hassle to have to make non-standard changes all over the place that you have to keep track of.<p>For your first attempt to solve this you decide to run postgres in a virtual machine and connect to that, but now you have an entire extra operating system to deal with and all of the overhead that comes with that.  Plus you have to configure access to the VM and get all of those pieces to work too.<p>It&#x27;d be nice if there was a way to just install postgres in a place that is easily accessible, but separate from the rest of your machine with regard to things like ports and such.  A &quot;container&quot; that it could be installed in that automatically handles things like port conflicts in some magical backend you don&#x27;t have to deal with so it looks to you like you can always just use the defaults.

There would be no need to criticize it for being somewhat centralized, because the option to run your own part would exist. And rather than powerlessly complaining about unilateral corporate decisions, even normal users could share software <i>fixes</i> instead.<p>The FSF itself might specifically not be capable of this (due to an aesthetic formed from decades of waging trench war), but a generic Free software organization certainly would be. What&#x27;s missing is the billion dollars to develop, refine, and endlessly promote this idea, because there is no scalable profit in actual Free software!<p>I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re actually disagreeing on the above lead-in topic - we&#x27;re just coming at this from wildly different paradigms.

Such things are against any basic sense of professional ethics - the same type of principle-agent violation as a sysadmin who creates a backdoor for their future self.<p>To bring this back to something concrete, look at the paradigm of control promulgated by contemporary bootloaders. Verifying running code is a worthwhile goal, but there is no reason this requires trust rooted in manufacturer-kept keys. Rooting the trust in symmetrical algorithms or user-loaded signing keys would accomplish the same exact goal while still preserving user freedom. And then the default scheme of only trusting code signed by the manufacturer would be implemented on top of that.

The primary explosive detonates and its energy detonates the secondary explosive. Those can go off by accident, cook off, etc.<p>The ones used in nuclear weapons are just inert wires. Without a hulking big electrical pulse (about a megawatt for a microsecond, which is one joule) they can&#x27;t do anything. A big capacitor bank is required to fire such things. It&#x27;s done this way because all the detonators have to go off within nanoseconds of each other to get the symmetrical implosion squeeze to work.

That&#x27;s happened a few times in plane crashes.<p>Newer (post-1950s) nuclear weapons don&#x27;t even have a full critical mass in them.

That boat is powered by a double-acting one-cylinder engine driving both side paddlewheels. It&#x27;s reversible, with some difficulty. It cannot get itself started at top dead center or bottom dead center.  So there&#x27;s a giant pry bar, about eight feet long, which can be used to get it started.

You&#x27;re coming into the dock, and have to stop and reverse the engine to slow.  If the stopping and reversing operation results in the engine stopped at dead center, there&#x27;s no power until the crew frantically gets the pry bar and levers the engine into a position where a power stroke is possible. Screw up and you crash into the dock.  It&#x27;s a ferry boat, so it docks a dozen times a day.<p>Now that&#x27;s a control problem.<p>The Eureka is the last surviving example of this design.

Now in Poland a lot more people can pass the official exam (it has two parts: theory, taken care of by my course, and shooting, which requires additional classes at a gun range), since learning is faster, simpler and more thorough.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;carlsednaoui&#x2F;ouicards\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;carlsednaoui&#x2F;ouicards</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patentstrzelecki.eu&#x2F;testy&#x2F;uobia-pozwolenie\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;patentstrzelecki.eu&#x2F;testy&#x2F;uobia-pozwolenie</a>","time":1509775444,"type":"comment"}

Because at this point they provide nothing but low-level overly verbose primitives to construct custom elements. Everything else has to be brought in in the form of helpers, third-party libs or, yes, frameworks (e.g., if you call React a framework, then Polymer is also a framework).<p>So, original comment said this:<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve recently tried to get into React seriously and I found myself getting stuck pretty quickly. I tried Vue.js which seem to be popular as well and I had a blast. I found the templates more intuitive, the documentation easier to read and the concepts just fun to use.<p>Your suggestion to go for Web Components because custom frameworks are crufty and unmanageable is disingenuous at best. You will end up with both custom frameworks on top of WebComponents <i>and</i> potential multiple issues that exist. Unless, of course, you go for &quot;hundreds of components on webcomponents.org&quot;, vast majority of whom use Polymer to plug all the holes in the spec.","time":1509782706,"type":"comment"}

It was done by going into the lion’s den, working with the people in industry. This is something I would not hesitate to recommend to young researchers; in order to affect the real world, one must go there and roll up one’s sleeves. One secret is to try to get a handle on the thought processes of the engineers doing the real work and who will ultimately use these ideas and tools. In my case, they were the avionics engineers, and when I do biological modeling, they are biologists. If what you come up with does not jibe with how they think, they will not use it. It’s that simple.”[2]<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il&#x2F;~harel&#x2F;papers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il&#x2F;~harel&#x2F;papers.html</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il&#x2F;~harel&#x2F;papers&#x2F;Statecharts.History.CACM.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il&#x2F;~harel&#x2F;papers&#x2F;Statecharts.H...</a>","time":1509792748,"type":"comment"}

For a relatively niche product it’s amazing to me that there are something like 10 very different but very high quality options to choose from.<p>And they have changed a lot in 15 years. Not that long ago you pretty much had to use hardware synths and samplers to create electronic music and DAWs were just used for recording or mixing tracks. Today you can create full tracks with just the included synths and samples, then you can play a live show straight from the same session, and there are tons of built in effects to get a great sounding mix. Plus details in the UI, routing tracks, editing audio and midi, beat detection of samples, etc are always improving with each release. I will grant you, a lot of the top companies (pro tools, logic, Cubase, ableton) were around in a similar form 15 years ago and some 25+ years ago, but that’s not totally crazy given how complex the software is.<p>As for something new coming along to mix it up, I’m curious what type of changes would meet that criteria? I’d say Ableton and more recently Bitwig (and I’m sure the argument could be made for many others that I’m less familiar with) have both done that.","time":1509798221,"type":"comment"}

For me personally it&#x27;s to a React&#x2F;RxJS front-end stack in combination with a traditional Ruby&#x2F;PostgreSQL&#x2F;REST api back-end. This had the disadvantage of losing the back-end reactivity Meteor is known for, but at the same time it&#x27;s a much more stable, decoupled and scalable stack. Meteor simply felt too much like a black box that caused a lot of scalability and maintainability problems in production. Its &quot;make reactive all the things&quot; model also gave (less experienced) developers a huge gun to shoot themselves in the foot with, causing a lot of performance issues.<p>If you want to keep all the reactivity goodness from Meteor I&#x27;d suggest taking a look at Firebase. Their new Cloud Firestore is very impressive and basically gives you all the features Meteor offers when you combined with a front-end framework like react or angular. Or you could take a more low-level approach and use something like Elixir&#x2F;Phoenix and PostgreSQL&#x27;s LISTEN&#x2F;NOTIFY to create your own reactive push streams, and subscribe to them in the front-end using a reactive library like RxJS.","time":1509798962,"type":"comment"}

It has been a while, but IIRC they just cache and diff way too much data for the reason that it saves bandwidth. Wrap their caching functions to forget the data when you know you don&#x27;t need it, and Meteor can become much more performant.<p>Still, I wouldn&#x27;t use Meteor for any kind of traditional website. It&#x27;s way too easy to introduce state on the server, but there shouldn&#x27;t be state on the server, and it&#x27;s way too easy to abuse reactivity and end up with a toy that tanks with trivial traffic.<p>I think polling is ultimately a better model because it allows each component to throttle itself at whatever pace is necessary. I can see Meteor being useful for applications that require a shared state on the server (or in Redis or something) like in online games, chat, or any other online multi-user real-time application.<p>But then Meteor became a tool for common websites that didn&#x27;t actually need reactivity, and people started abusing server state, reactivity, etc. I think at some point, the community was begging for options to turn reactivity off by default or in certain cases.<p>Meteor apps consume less data but take up a ton of server resources. Overall, the problems introduced by polling were just traded for DDP&#x27;s own problems. The problem of &quot;sending data to the client in real time&quot; might not even be an important problem. If the client looks at a page every 20 seconds, then there&#x27;s no reason for the page to be updating for an empty audience.<p>I think Meteor is building something called Apollo now which uses some sort of intermediary caching server to keep track of data versions, which the client then polls for updates to the data it depends on. At a first glance, it looks like they just took the problem with DDP and moved it into an independent system.

This way, wolkenkit is a pretty good fit if you do domain-driven design (DDD), but you do not need to do DDD to use wolkenkit.<p>wolkenkit gives you the option to focus on your domain expertise, and provides all the technical stuff below, such as persistence, authentication, real-time updates, and so on…<p>We built it based upon CQRS and event-sourcing, so you have a pretty good foundation for scaling and reporting &#x2F; analyzing data. As it&#x27;s only for the backend, you are free to use any UI framework you want to use, but we have a client-side SDK for JavaScript to assist you.<p>You can find more information at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolkenkit.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolkenkit.io&#x2F;</a> and in its documentation <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.wolkenkit.io&#x2F;1.1.0&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.wolkenkit.io&#x2F;1.1.0&#x2F;</a><p>If you just want to get started with the concepts, have a look at our 68-pages brochure on DDD, CQRS, event-sourcing and wolkenkit: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.wolkenkit.io&#x2F;1.1.0&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;brochure&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.wolkenkit.io&#x2F;1.1.0&#x2F;downloads&#x2F;brochure&#x2F;</a><p>wolkenkit is available as open-source and under a commercial license. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us.<p>PS: At first, wolkenkit feels somewhat strange, if you are not used to CQRS, event-sourcing &amp; co., but once you get it, I think it is a pretty good approach to developing software.","time":1509801523,"type":"comment"}

It also describes hooks on INSERT&#x2F;UPDATE&#x2F;DELETE (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guide.meteor.com&#x2F;collections.html#hooks\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guide.meteor.com&#x2F;collections.html#hooks</a>).<p>This pretty much shows how Meteor sees data: It&#x27;s a &quot;thing&quot; that can be created, edited, deleted. That&#x27;s it. It does not live on its own.<p>E.g., when you design a shopping cart, you can create a shopping cart, you can update it (which means adding items to it, or removing items from it, or changing the numbers of items in it, …), and you can finally delete it (when the user submits their order, or when they cancel their shopping tour).<p>What you can NOT do is to access your data using the verbs that are relevant for your domain:<p>- Put an item to the shopping cart\n- Increase the count of a specific item\n- Decrease the count of a specific item\n- Remove an item from the shopping cart\n- Discard the shopping card<p>For the domain &quot;shopping&quot;, all these actions are relevant, and if you have to map them to CRUD actions, you lose semantics. What&#x27;s even worse, update and delete are destructive actions, so you don&#x27;t have any historical data. Of course you can implement all this, but you have to do it on your own.<p>wolkenkit, in contrast, uses event-sourcing, which works more like Git: Changes are collected, and you can replay them (either all to get the current state, or some of them for arbitrary analytics).<p>That&#x27;s IMHO a major difference on whether you are using a CRUD-like foundation, or another approach.<p>We have also blogged about this: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thenativeweb.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2017-10-25-09-46-ddd-and-co-part-1-whats-wrong-with-crud&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thenativeweb.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2017-10-25-09-46-ddd-and-co...</a> and <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thenativeweb.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2017-11-01-11-13-ddd-and-co-part-2-semantics-over-crud&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thenativeweb.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2017-11-01-11-13-ddd-and-co...</a>","time":1509802182,"type":"comment"}

That&#x27;s why there are laws like minimum wage and other protections of the workers. The globalization is not just a way of getting things for cheap, it also a workaround for laws which prohibit investors from paying <i>too</i> little.<p>It&#x27;s unfair, in my opinion, even if the worker does benefit. It gets much worse when the workers don&#x27;t benefit at all. For example, in EU, we currently have a heated debate about delegated workers - people employed in one country and working (and living) in another. Companies do this to dodge the laws - minimum wage, social benefits, and so on - of their own country, while the workers suffer the higher costs of living in the richer country. It also makes the richer country native workers screwed. It&#x27;s probably going to become illegal in the next couple of years.<p>People working remotely are in a different situation, in that they indeed live in a cheaper place. They still get paid much less than the minimum wage of the richer country where the investor comes from, which I think is also unfair. Also, the &quot;cheaper place&quot; is often not really - the prices in these countries are getting ever closer to the richer countries, while the wages lag behind the prices significantly.<p>In other words, there should be - and is, in many places - a limit on how badly workers can be exploited. The globalization is a loophole which circumvents these laws. I hope it will get closed in the future.<p>EDIT: note that it&#x27;s definitely not the <i>only</i> way globalization affects people and many effects of globalization are positive.

In Javascript-framework land this is really unique. We&#x27;ve been able to keep adding features, expanding our product and building for our customers. While at the same time continuously update our codebase to the latest and greatest.<p>- By far the best easiest way to do code splitting (since 1.5) without any configuration or overlap in bundles. I don&#x27;t know about any other tool that offers something similar. Webpack doesn&#x27;t even come close in this area.<p>- Because they had node-fibers to get synchronous code from the start, now it&#x27;s really easy to adopt to async&#x2F;await.<p>- They have good integrations for React, Angular 1 &amp; 2, Blaze and there are third-party integrations for Vue (haven&#x27;t used that one myself)<p>- They&#x27;re also the same people behind Apollo which people do seem to like for their data layer.

We don&#x27;t know how severe the injuries were, but without insurance, even something relatively minor can wipe you out.<p>Back in the day, many employers provided insurance plans which would cover for things like this. The employee would miss some time for the injury, but the medical costs were largely covered. My parents were relatively poor and I had a life-threatening illness (months in the hospital) which was fully covered by insurance.<p>When you&#x27;re working for yourself, you have to cover for these potential disasters. Money pending in your Freelancer account shouldn&#x27;t be part of that planning.","time":1509806502,"type":"comment"}

It then recursively traces all the imports from there, creates a dependency tree, and bundles all those individual files into a single output bundle.  You can also configure it to transform files along the way, allowing you to compile newer JS syntax into older syntax with Babel, import images and styles into your JS bundle, and much more.  It also allows you to set up code splitting so that common code shared between different bundles is extracted into a separate bundle file, and parts of your app can be dynamically loaded after the initial app starts up.","time":1509806783,"type":"comment"}

For most applications Meteor becomes a real pain in the ass. I wrote several applications for multiple clients, in 4 years I haven&#x27;t wrote a single one that used the real-time features properly. A tradicional stack is simply much more flexible when compared to Meteor.<p>The problem today is that Meteor is not a component that you can&#x27;t easily plug and play like Angular, React, Express, etc. Example: You would like provided a real-time widget on another website? Open an iframe and load the entire application and waste more than 300 megabytes on the browser. Or use a non-official package and hack the shit out of it.<p>MDG (Company who developed and maintains Meteor) went too greedy. In order to use Meteor you have to be fully committed to the stack. Although the project is open source, you will waste several hours trying to modify Meteor to be make it more modular. Event today if you want to use the DDP protocol outside of Meteor, you&#x27;ve to use 3rd party non official packages. Meteor was great in the beginning but failed to play nicely with the rest of the JS ecosystem even although some work was done in that direction. Arunoda played a HUGE role by building and writing a lot.<p>As a prototype tool Meteor is excellent, it&#x27;s very hard to find a framework&#x2F;tool that provides what Meteor provides. Building a real-time application with modular components isn&#x27;t trivial, Meteor just offers a lot for free: LiveQuery, Authentication, Server-Client shared code, Consistent API, client side implementation of MongoDB (minimongo), painless build system, easy deployment, etc. You can build a prototype in record time.<p>Play with Meteor, you won&#x27;t regret it. Scaling applications is always hard, requires in depth knowledge and time. Meteor is websocket based, there is not need to compare with an HTTP based API since it is unfair. Scaling a real-time application is hard on any language&#x2F;framework. For most projects FireBase will do the trick if you&#x27;ve a small number of real-time components.<p>My advice: Pick the right tool for the right job. Most of the complains typically come from project that are not a decent match for real-time applications. I worked on many project because someone decided to use Meteor regardless of their technical knowledge to decide so.","time":1509808135,"type":"comment"}

To a first approximation, &quot;everything&quot; is using an event loop nowadays, in that everything is using the same fundamental primitives to handle and dispatch events. In particular, this includes the Go runtime; run &quot;strace&quot; on a Go network program and you&#x27;ll see these same calls pop up in the strace.<p>What this does instead is give a Go program <i>direct</i> access to the event loop. The benefit is that it bypasses all of the stuff that Go wraps around the internal event loop call that allows it to implement the way it offers a thread-like interface for you, and integrates with the channel and concurrency primitives, and maintains your position in the call stack between events, etc. The penalty is... the exact same thing, that you lose all the nice stuff that the Go runtime offers to you to implement the thread-like interface, etc., and are back to a lower-level interface that offers less services.<p>The performance of the Go runtime is &quot;pretty good&quot;, especially by scripting language standards, but if you have sufficiently high performance requirements, you will not want to pay the overhead. The pathological case for all of these nice high-level abstractions is a server that handles a ton of network traffic of some sort and needs to do a little something to every request, maybe just a couple dozen <i>cycle&#x27;s</i> worth of something, at which point paying what could be a few hundred cycles for all this runtime nice stuff that you&#x27;re not using becomes a significant performance drain. Most people are not doing things where they can service a network request in a few dozen cycles, and the longer it takes to service a single request the more sense it makes to have a nice runtime layer providing you useful services, as it drops in the percentage of CPU time consumed by your program. For the most part, if you are so much as hitting a database over a network connection, even a local one, in your request, you&#x27;ve already greatly exceeded the amount of time you&#x27;re paying to the runtime, for instance.<p>It does seem to me that a lot of people are a bit bedazzled by the top-level stuff that various languages offer, and forget that under the hood, everyone&#x27;s using the event-based interfaces. What differs between Node and Twisted and all of the dozens or hundreds of other viable wrappers over these calls is the services automatically provided, not whether or not they are &quot;event loops&quot;. Go is an event loop at the kernel level. Node is an event loop at the kernel level. Erlang is an event loop at the kernel level. They aren&#x27;t all the same, but &quot;event-based&quot; vs. &quot;not event-based&quot; is not the distinction; it&#x27;s a question of what they lay on top of the underlying event loop, not whether they use it. Even pure OS threads are, ultimately, event loops under the hood, just in the kernel rather than the user space.","time":1509809123,"type":"comment"}

It is not about library elegance and simplicity, it&#x27;s all about making it easy to use.

I ask for 50% but it could depend on your negotiation skills. If a client is not willing to put at least something upfront, then they are not   a good client. Most likely, they will nickel and dime you.<p>3. Discuss the IP upfront. If client wants full exclusive ownership, your price should cover that. If you want to retain ownership but license it out to client, make that clear and reflect in your price.<p>4. Write the &quot;scope&quot; of the project as clear as possible. The scope defines the &quot;what&quot;. The &quot;hows&quot; can vary a bit but try to ensure the client is clear on &quot;what&quot; is being delivered. Google &quot;scope creep&quot; if you are not sure about this.<p>5. Setup milestones by time and scope items. For each milestone, make sure the client pays. This will ensure that the client is serious and stays on track. If there is no milestone based payment, client could go missing. In worst cases, they may just drop the whole thing. Better to know sooner than later.<p>6. Be very clear with the client. If an answer is &quot;No&quot;, then don&#x27;t sugarcoat it. Say No. Saying No upfront is 100 times better than saying No later when client expectations are different.<p>Most importantly, build trust with client but make sure they respect your time and skills.","time":1509811683,"type":"comment"}

This is largely a result of local laws and how the IRS equivalent is set up. Take Germany for instance. The tax code in Germany discourages freelancing in favor of running a &gt;10 person company or finding steady employment. The main reason is what taxes one pays for &quot;real employees&quot; and how that lands in the national support system accounts. This is a valid justification on the state&#x27;s part, but a FOSS developer living in Germany who isn&#x27;t already doing freelancing and has all the tax complexity and insecurity taken care of is hard pressed to start accepting random donations.

The way we do it is by having a single global state store (like redux) with one incoming RxJS stream for writing to that store, and one outgoing stream that emits the latest snapshot of the store whenever a change is made to it. A component can then subscribe to that stream and filter it so it only gets an emitted value when the data it cares about changes. And because there&#x27;s only one incoming and one outgoing stream it&#x27;s very easy to debug and see what&#x27;s going on in the app, making it very predictable and transparent. Also, like I said before: almost no boilerplate code at all!","time":1509816368,"type":"comment"}

Dude on her right immediately got up, wanting no part of it, and she slid over, taking up both seats, then proceeded to mutter profanity at me. &quot;F&#x27;ng a----.

Just crazy, I guess.<p>Normally I would angrily confront a stranger who just punched me in the stomach and started swearing at me for no good reason but I thought, &quot;Hey, I just resolved a few hours ago to be zen on the subway, am I going to break my new resolution on the first day?&quot;<p>Fast-forward through the rest of the subway ride, I said and did nothing while she kept muttering profanity (and staring right at me).

I run a startup, and of course I agree with you about sales and marketing. See [1] for my thoughts on this)<p>&gt; That a business is run by one person is irrelevant.<p>I disagree with you here. In your system, there is a binary designation for individuals: either you are an individual employee, you have given up a large part of your freedom in exchange for the security of being gainfully employed; or you are a freelancer, and therefore no different from a single-person software development business, and are 100% exposed, to the same degree corporations are held (or lesser, see &#x27;bailouts&#x27;), to the conditions of free market economy.<p>But <i>of course</i> this isn&#x27;t, shouldn&#x27;t and can&#x27;t be binary. There <i>currently exists millions of people</i> somewhere in the middle of this spectrum right now, millions of counterexamples to this story, of people who lived entire lives as freelancers working through an agency like upwork or freelancer. They&#x27;re here, they exist, they&#x27;re humans just like you and I.<p>Not wanting to be responsible for all aspects of business is <i>exactly why</i> they go to places like freelancer.com, upwork, Uber, taskrabbit, etc.<p>Victim blamers are basically telling that person that they didn&#x27;t &quot;do their life good enough&quot; and they don&#x27;t deserve a social safety net, and that somehow they &quot;had it coming&quot; and &quot;deserved to get screwed&quot; because they didn&#x27;t share your definition of a what a freelancer should be. They behaved too much like an individual and not enough like a business, so they got what they deserved. Despite the millions of people who <i>aren&#x27;t</i> economically efficient yet hoisted up by the social safety net, for instance any union member, anyone on social security or welfare, anyone on food stamps, in government housing, anyone who benefits from subsidies, etc.<p>But let&#x27;s pick on this one particular guy who deserved to have his life ruined by a customer service rep with a grudge because he dared to think he could get away with being a simple person - an individual human, not a business - with the freedom to work 25 hours a week because he got sick a year prior. Fuck <i>that</i> guy.<p>I am taking this position to an absurd degree, but to illustrate my point, here&#x27;s what&#x27;s really at the core of the victim-blaming position: &quot;You&#x27;re a freelancer who <i>didn&#x27;t</i> want to be responsible for sales and marketing, so that you could just lead a straightforward technical life without the rigid constraints of being a full time employeee? Fuck you, you deserved to get screwed over for not treating your life like a business, like the rest of us!&quot;<p>I think this is one of those strange ways in which capitalism has affected our worldview. I do consider myself a capitalist, but I have to admit that the idea of expecting individuals to behave as businesses would doesn&#x27;t sit right with me.<p>At the end of the day, a customer service representative with a grudge (allegedly) had the power to hold earnings back from the person who earned them. <i>That would bankrupt a business too</i>, if it happened at the wrong time or under the right circumstances. Your bank refusing to deposit your checks for 2 months would wreak havok on like 70% of Americans&#x27; lives! We are <i>all</i> dependent on others in so many ways that we can&#x27;t pick on this guy for also being dependent.<p>Instead, let&#x27;s call out the actual bad actor here.

However, with improvements start within 1.3 and onward, every release has gotten better. Meteor 1.6 has the same concepts as Meteor 1.0, however it is extremely different and is up to date with standards of the Node&#x2F;JS ecosystem.<p>I think it&#x27;s important to know it&#x27;s application and use-case. I use it for a hybrid iOS&#x2F;Android app, and Meteor + Cordova has been fantastic in terms of developer productivity for a small&#x2F;medium-sized app. As a startup, I wouldn&#x27;t consider anything else right now for new projects. React Native has a higher learning overhead, and with other architectures you always have to deal with user registration &amp; authentication, something Meteor supplies out of the box.<p>In terms of performance, it is important to understand the core concepts of Meteor. This is not easy. The reactivity layer and publish concepts make it extremely easy to overpublish data, reckoning your Meteor app completely useless. Afaik, something like Kadira is required for Meteor apps, as it will quickly tell you when something is wrong. If a Meteor app is correctly designed, it should rarely have performance issues.<p>I&#x27;ve wanted to integrate Redux into my Meteor app, however there are a lot of moving parts getting both working together, so I&#x27;m opting for smaller container components. React performance is tricky in any case, and Meteor + React is no exception. This combo makes it a bit difficult to diagnose performance issues on the rendering layer. I would love to migrate to VueJS, however the it would require a complete re-write, just as I&#x27;m getting comfy with React. I would highly recommend VueJS + Meteor + Vuex over Meteor + React for new projects, so you don&#x27;t deal with diagnosing rendering performance problems with Meteor&#x27;s reactivity layer.<p>You can definitely run your own React stack that is decoupled. For a larger app, I would recommend going this route, due to the big build system of Meteor. Once your app gets a bit too large, the builds still take forever. You can offset it by using something like React Storybook with hot module reloads, but if you have a high number of users or a requirement to not use Mongo, you are better moving the other way. Meteor Development Group is moving out of the built-in reactivity layer that it is known for, and into GraphQL. I&#x27;m not planning to move to this new architecture anytime soon, and will run with Meteor&#x27;s reactivity layer for the foreseeable future. I&#x27;m concerned once the reactivity layer loses focus and development, that Meteor may start to fade away. GraphQL has a high learning overhead IMO and presents it&#x27;s own sets of issues. Perhaps those will be worked out over time.<p>My 2c. Without Meteor I wouldn&#x27;t have a real-time web app as nice as I do now with both iOS and Android builds, up and running as quickly and easily as I have. It&#x27;s been a godsend.","time":1509818497,"type":"comment"}

People are comparing services like Upwork to a typical contracting arrangement in the U.S.<p>Amazon hires contract workers for their warehouses and perhaps they do this directly. Many other companies hire contracters through temp agencies.<p>Imagine walking through the door of Upwork as if it were some sort of temp agency. Imagine you meet with a rep who interviews you and goes over how the temp agency works, but it&#x27;s actually the Upwork or Freelancer terms.<p>You would likely tell the rep that he&#x2F;she is <i></i><i></i>ing nuts and walk out the door. I can&#x27;t imagine there are temp agencies which work like that. The closest I can think of is day labor, but I&#x27;m pretty sure those workers don&#x27;t have to worry about getting paid at the end of their work day.<p>I guess I couldn&#x27;t get this through my head because of how horrible of an idea it would be to me. On the other hand, I think playing slot machines is incredibly stupid, yet people love to do it.<p>People have a bit of a responsibility to understand the model of what they are dealing with. There are endless ways to make money, but not endless ways in which you will get protection. If you work for an employer, you get looked after and you&#x27;re likely to get paid. If you try to make money trading, then you&#x27;re likely to get chewed up and spit out. If you try to join an MLM scheme, then you better know how these things work or you won&#x27;t get anywhere.<p>The model of running a business is that you better run your life properly. You better have your adult pants ready to go. Freelance software developers have it easy, most of the solo devs just lose their time when they get screwed. Back before the internet, an entrepeneur might lose everything (like my parents did).<p>I think there is a reality warp which people go through when they think of freelance software development. It&#x27;s way too easy to shoot yourself in the foot by going this route and there is little to stop you. It&#x27;s as easy as walking into a casino and walking out completely cleaned out. Perhaps the government should insist that Upwork places a warning label on its site, like a pack of cigarettes. It should put pictures of homeless people, just as an added scare tactic. Because it&#x27;s a really bad idea to sign up with a service like this if you don&#x27;t fully know what you are getting into.<p>You&#x27;re right that a business can go bankrupt with one key missed payment or withheld check.

For introverts, going out to a bar or party may take away energy, for extroverts, it may give them energy. It doesn&#x27;t really matter whether something gives or takes energy, but it&#x27;s important that you&#x27;re realistic with yourself about it. Socializing with friends may be good, but it may be an energy-taker.<p>Once you know what gives&#x2F;takes energy, create a mock schedule that provides balance between the two. Then, play with the numbers to create an ideal balance.<p>For me, work is an energy-taker, but it&#x27;s essential so I can do things that give me energy, like play games, volunteer, work out, etc. I&#x27;ve found that when I work 50-60 hours per week, I really just need about a solid day where I can just do things that give me energy, so Saturdays I keep free to play, hang out, and only do things that give me energy. Sundays I balance my time with things that give me energy (like watching football) and things that take energy (like chores).<p>That&#x27;s sort of the high-level planning I do.

I do email, get some water, stretch during that 5 minutes, and then immediately get back to work. That essentially gives me 16-20 &quot;buckets&quot; of time to work on my projects (8-10 hours), so I break my work out into those buckets, and plan accordingly.<p>I&#x27;m an accountant, so this may be different.
