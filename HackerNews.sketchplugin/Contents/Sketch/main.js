It pops up a &quot;Search Everywhere&quot; box, and you can type filenames, symbol names, actions (Rename, etc)... it&#x27;s basically helm M-x, but way better.<p>You won&#x27;t ever feel like &quot;CSS names are bad!&quot; because you won&#x27;t ever need to remember anything. Want to center something? Just type &quot;align&quot; and usually webstorm pops up autocomplete with the right thing.

Doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s C++, ocaml, or VueJS. Typing shift-shift will always let me jump to definitions.<p>Yeah it costs money, but $13&#x2F;mo is super reasonble.

Monday saw a nationwide series of outages as well, but with a more pedestrian cause: a misconfiguration at Level 3, an internet backbone company—and enterprise ISP—that underpins other big networks. Network analysts say that the misconfiguration was a routing issue that created a ripple effect, causing problems for companies like Comcast, Spectrum, Verizon, Cox, and RCN across the country.\nLevel 3, whose acquisition by CenturyLink closed recently, said in a statement to WIRED that it resolved the issue in about 90 minutes. &quot;Our network experienced a service disruption affecting some customers with IP-based services,&quot; the company said. &quot;The disruption was caused by a configuration error.&quot; Comcast users started reporting internet outages around the time of the Level 3 outages on Monday, but the company said that it was monitoring &quot;an external network issue&quot; and not a problem with its own infrastructure. RCN confirmed that it had some network problems on Monday because of Level 3. The company said it had restored RCN service by rerouting traffic to a different backbone.<p>The misconfiguration was a &quot;route leak,&quot; according to Roland Dobbins, a principal engineer at the DDoS and network-security firm Arbor Networks, which monitors global internet operations. ISPs use &quot;Autonomous Systems,&quot; also known as ASes, to keep track of what IP addresses are on which networks, and route packets of data between them. They use the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to establish and communicate routes. For example, packets can route between networks A and B, but network A can also route packets to network C through network B, and so on. This is how internet service providers interoperate to let you browse the whole internet, not just the IP addresses on their own networks.<p>In a &quot;route leak,&quot; an AS, or multiple ASes, issue incorrect information about the IP addresses on their network, which causes inefficient routing and failures for both the originating ISP and other ISPs trying to route traffic through. Think of it like a series of street signs that help keep traffic flowing in the right directions. If some of them are mislabeled or point the wrong way, assorted chaos can ensue.<p>Route leaks can be malicious, sometimes called &quot;route hijacks&quot; or &quot;BGP hijacks,&quot; but Monday&#x27;s incident seems to have been caused by a simple mistake that ballooned to have national impact. Large outages caused by accidental route leaks have cropped up before.\n&quot;Folks are looking to tweak routing policies, and make mistakes,&quot; Arbor Networks&#x27; Dobbins says. The problem could have come as CenturyLink works to integrate the Level 3 network, or could have stemmed from typical traffic engineering and efficiency work.<p>Internet outages of all sizes caused by route leaks have occurred occasionally, but consistently, for decades. ISPs attempt to minimize them using &quot;route filters&quot; that check the IP routes their peers and customers intend to use to send and receive packets, and attempt to catch any problematic plans. But these filters are difficult to maintain on the scale of the modern internet, and can have their own mistakes.\nMonday&#x27;s outages reinforce how precarious connectivity really is, and how certain aspects of the internet&#x27;s architecture—offering flexibility and ease-of-use—can introduce instability into what has become a vital service.","time":1510017391,"type":"comment"}

The licenses are clear, and no one is promising anything magically wonderful or terrible to happen depending on my engagement in it. If they do and I bite, maybe I am dumb.<p><i>&gt; If you make some software, and someone tells you how great it would be if it did different things, and then gets offended when you send them your day-rate, so you do it anyway, then someone has convinced you to work for free.</i><p>No, they have freed themselves from the responsibility of paying me for the work, clearly making it my problem.

It doesn&#x27;t make sense to me: In a twisted sort of way, a slaveowner is more free than a non-slaveowner because they don&#x27;t have obligations (like to work), but it doesn&#x27;t make this sort of thing right. Being a slaveowner isn&#x27;t right even if being free is.</i><p>&quot;Open source&quot; is not &quot;more free&quot; in any general sense. It just means that the source is available for free use and distribution. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily make <i>you</i> more free, nor does it make anyone that is subject to whatever malicious purpose the software might serve more free. It frees the user of the software from a tiny set of specific obligations normally associated with licensing a copyright protected work. Those other things may be important but not at all what the BSD license concerns.

That you reimburse yourself for the time it takes you to develop the software by charging for copies of it is an arbitrary choice, not an inherent relationship between the time spent and the number of copies made. If you were chopping wood, it might be a different matter, but with software, the time is spent on producing it, and selling a copy of piece of software doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t sell it again. The money you receive for a copy of a piece of software is rent.<p>Tanenbaum makes a great example of this. He is being paid for his work, yet the software is open source. He is not being paid for copies. Another good example is that of a simple employee. I get paid a monthly salary for performing a day job. Like Tanenbaum, I might get much less value out of it than the users of the software (or whoever is selling it) do, but I certainly don&#x27;t work for free.

First, I REALLY am not angry with Linus. HONEST. He&#x27;s not angry with me either. I am not some kind of &quot;sore loser&quot; who feels he has been eclipsed by Linus. MINIX was only a kind of fun hobby for me. I am a professor. I teach and do research and write books and go to conferences and do things professors do. I like my job and my students and my university. [...] I wrote MINIX because I wanted my students to have hands-on experience playing with an operating system. After AT&amp;T forbade teaching from John Lions&#x27; book, I decided to write a UNIX-like system for my students to play with. [...] I was not trying to replace GNU&#x2F;HURD or Berkeley UNIX. Heaven knows, I have said this enough times. I just wanted to show my students and other students how you could write a UNIX-like system using modern technology. A lot of other people wanted a free production UNIX with lots of bells and whistles and wanted to convert MINIX into that. I was dragged along in the maelstrom for a while, but when Linux came along, I was actually relieved that I could go back to professoring. [...] Linus seems to be doing excellent work and I wish him much success in the future.<p>While writing MINIX was fun, I don&#x27;t really regard it as the most important thing I have ever done. It was more of a distraction than anything else. The most important thing I have done is produce a number of incredibly good students, especially Ph.D. students. See my home page for the list. They have done great things. I am as proud as a mother hen. To the extent that Linus can be counted as my student, I&#x27;m proud of him, too. Professors like it when their students go on to greater glory.&quot;","time":1510076188,"type":"comment"}

Rather, it may be more useful to say that media attention for your story wins elections, and typically money is a good proxy in terms of the purchasing power to get your story out there. Whether that&#x27;s via pure advertising, or financing community organisers, or the best PR, money is a solid proxy. And Trump was exceptional in that he had celebrity status and an incendiary message that didn&#x27;t need much money to get attention, combined with an exceptional time of social media that magnifies incendiary messages very cheaply and buries nuance as nuance doesn&#x27;t go viral.<p>It&#x27;ll remain to be seen if this will become the new model, or whether money will continue to be the best predictor of election outcomes. I think the model will change, but the latter statement will remain true.<p>Of course, by vote-outcomes indeed her campaign (and you may say, her money) did win her more votes. So even this election could be viewed as business-as-usual, the Democrats and its leader got the most votes.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s lots of speculation about spending that aren&#x27;t part of the official figures.

An example would be Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) where the driver controls steering and the automated system controls speed. Using Parking Assistance, steering is automated while speed is manual. The driver must be ready to retake full control at any time. Lane Keeping Assistance (LKA) Type II is a further example of level 1 self driving.<p>&gt;    Level 2 (”hands off”): The automated system takes full control of the vehicle (accelerating, braking, and steering). The driver must monitor the driving and be prepared to immediately intervene at any time if the automated system fails to respond properly. The shorthand ”hands off” is not meant to be taken literally. In fact, contact between hand and wheel is often mandatory during SAE 2 driving, to confirm that the driver is ready to intervene.<p>&gt;    Level 3 (”eyes off”): The driver can safely turn their attention away from the driving tasks, e.g. the driver can text or watch a movie. The vehicle will handle situations that call for an immediate response, like emergency braking. The driver must still be prepared to intervene within some limited time, specified by the manufacturer, when called upon by the vehicle to do so. In 2017 the Audi A8 Luxury Sedan was the first commercial car to claim to be able to do level 3 self driving. The car has a so called Traffic Jam Pilot. When activated by the human driver the car takes full control of all aspects of driving in slow-moving traffic at up to 60 kilometers per hour. The function only works on highways with a physical barrier separating oncoming traffic.<p>&gt;    Level 4 (”mind off”): As level 3, but no driver attention is ever required for safety, i.e. the driver may safely go to sleep or leave the driver&#x27;s seat. Self driving is supported only in limited areas (geofenced) or under special circumstances, like traffic jams. Outside of these areas or circumstances, the vehicle must be able to safely abort the trip, i.e. park the car, if the driver does not retake control.<p>&gt;    Level 5 (”steering wheel optional”): No human intervention is required. An example would be a robotic taxi.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Autonomous_car#Levels_of_driving_automation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Autonomous_car#Levels_of_drivi...</a>","time":1510079814,"type":"comment"}

Like you, I too believe that a large population may prefer Lyft&#x2F;Uber type services instead of dealing with the concerns of owning one (e.g., parking, requiring space for parking, insurance, time spent in fueling, maintenance, etc.).<p>However, I tend to think that there still may be a decent size of population who&#x27;d prefer owning. Others mentioned the convenience of using cars for storage, being readily available, lower cost of owning, reduced insurances, customizations, etc. Along with these, I believe some other factors exist.<p>In context of self-driving cars, we typically tend to picture urban transportation first. However, there will still be needs for long distance commuting, or taking long trips for pleasure. There will always be places where people frequent less compared to major spots&#x2F;suburbs in a city.<p>People may not always want to hop into a random car every time they take a trip. The cost&#x2F;time involved in flagging a car of your choice may not be worth the effort for some. Also, keep in mind that many think of cars as a statement, another way of expressing their beliefs.

I carried my kids sequentially in a back-pack (3 years separation, so #1 was walking everywhere when #2 came along) and managed to fit all the above (aside from movies) into the back pocket of the kid backpack (strongly recommended for the transition to walking, incidentally, as a backpack is almost zero hassle when empty, while a stroller is just as hard to push empty as full).<p>But back on topic: you could lease a car&#x2F;van for the Peak Kid bit of your life and still save money.","time":1510089959,"type":"comment"}

As soon as another company develops self-driving technology that meets safety standards it can undercut Waymo and capture a significant market share. In 10 years self driving tech will be a commodity product - any car manufacturer&#x2F;ride hailing company will be able to choose between a half-dozen offerings.<p>This is what I&#x27;m most excited about. Currently ride sharing market isn&#x27;t very competitive because its hard for new entrants to get the network effects going of drivers and passengers. With driverless cars, once the tech is commoditized, any large-ish company could theoretically offer a ride sharing service - it just becomes a financing problem to lease the cars which I believe will allow for more entrants (not mom and pops, but many more corps can jump in).<p>&gt; But car manucturers are still in for long-term pain because their product is also becoming a commodity: nobody cares about the colour or horsepower of the taxi they take to work.<p>Maybe they don&#x27;t care about color and horsepower but they might care about other features. Comfort, tech bells and whistles, layout (all the seats face inwards with a poker table in the middle), or just straight luxury. On that last point, there are many high end cars that aren&#x27;t meant to be driven by their owners. The owners are meant to sit in the back and enjoy.<p>I&#x27;m still unsure whether net cars will go up or go down, theirs arguments on both sides.","time":1510105411,"type":"comment"}

Information such as a user name, message read status - even on public messages, etc. If you do CDN cache those pages you&#x27;ll leak user-specific information to other users. This is why you need tools like Varnish that cache page <i>fragments</i> rather than whole pages; or why you serve up HTML templates and then populate user information on the client side via RESTful API calls.<p>2) For similar reasons as above and again very relevant to the project in this discussion, HTTP Cache-Control headers also wouldn&#x27;t help with the HTML if your backend is generating the HTML. In fact in those instances you&#x27;d probably want to set your max-age to 0 (again, speaking strictly about dynamically generated HTML.

(This has nothing to do with current politics, by the way. I am not following the U.S. tax discussion and it&#x27;s not relevant to my point. My point is that whether it&#x27;s business, tech, or government, complexity itself is an enemy)","time":1510147174,"type":"comment"}

I run a small company as well, and taxes are a damn maze.<p>I just checked the tax authorities website in this country, and there are no less than 121 different tax-exempt health activities – things my company can pay for me, without having to also pay taxes. For most other things, there&#x27;s sales tax (possibly other kinds of tax too, but let&#x27;s limit it ourselves for brevity) that comes in at no less than three different levels, depending on what you&#x27;re paying for. Many things, most things, my company <i>can&#x27;t legally</i> pay for directly, but must pay me income, which I then pay for, as well as paying the taxes. This probably makes sense, except of course now I&#x27;m being taxed twice: once on the income itself, and then again on the expense. Oh unless of course it&#x27;s a deductible expense, in which case I might be able to deduct it from my year end declaration. Also this depends on what it is I&#x27;m paying for, some services are subsidized and the subsidy is applied immediately, so I&#x27;m only paying half the taxes – unless I&#x27;ve used up my subsidy limit (which I can&#x27;t check.)<p>I don&#x27;t mind paying taxes, I really don&#x27;t, because I can clearly see what I get for them for the most part.

It used to be the case that a UK contractor paying themselves through this structure was significantly better off due to the large amount of dividend tax credits that were available.<p>So let me outline how this works these days as I run up against this argument a lot.<p>1)  Any income that comes into the UK Ltd company is taxed at the corporate tax rate which as of this year is 19%.\n1.1) This tax is paid on profit so if you pay yourself a normal salary out of this you will deduct this from the profits. Take note that dividends are NOT deductible from company profits before tax and as such is not a way for you to reduce your tax liability as a UK company. Dividends are only payable from after taxed money in your UK Ltd company.\n1.2) Any expenses your company has in providing its services are deducted from profits. There is a misconception that you can write off A LOT of expenses but in actual fact that is not true. There are strict guide lines. Most of these expenses are also only valid if you are truly outside of IR35. Once you fall inside of it your allowed expenses decrease even more.<p>The above leaves you with your taxable company profit on which you pay your 19% corporation tax. (This is the tax that are being circumvented in the article by big companies.)<p>So now you as a UK Freelancer you now get the opportunity to pay yourself money from your UK Ltd company. You are then subjected to the following personal income tax:\n1) Your tax free allowance as an individual is applied so you pay no tax on the first £11500 of income.\n2) The first £5000 of dividends are also tax free. (remember this money has already been taxed at 19% in your corporation tax so is hardly free)\n3) All other dividends that you then pay out to yourself are taxed as per the different tax brackets set out for personal income tax on dividends. (Again remember that 19% tax has already been paid on the this money before you can distribute it to yourself.)<p>So lets look at an example:\n- Lets say that as a contractor you work for 10 months (42 weeks) out of the year at £500 per day. We also assume you have no problem in getting your clients to pay (a real risk in certain industries). That leaves you with 210 days that you bill at £500 per day. 210 * 500 = £105000 which is your income coming into the company before deducting allowed expenses.\n- Lets now say you are not inside IR35 and you can claim travel and subsistence against this amount. That normally works out at around £500 per month of expenses you can deduct. (We assume you have already bought your equipment that you use on site etc.)\n- You also need to pay your accountant, which does not work for free, the going rate in London is around £130 per month\n- You now pay yourself a small salary up to the allowed personal allowance for the year of £11500<p>Your total corporate taxable income is now as follows:\n 105,000\n-1,560 (Accountancy fees £130 x 12 months)\n-5,000 (£500 expenses for the 10 months of billable work)\n-11,500 (salary of around £958 per month for the 12 months of the financial year) =86,940 (This is the amount you pay corporation tax on) -16,518.60 (The amount of corporation tax you pay at 19% on the above £86940)\n=70,421.40 (This is the amount you can now distribute to yourself in dividends)<p>So now your personal income tax looks as follows:\n 11,500 (Salary received up to tax free allowance and tax of 0%)\n 5,000 (Dividends with 0% tax allowance)\n 65,421.40 (Remaining dividends that you are taxed)\n-14,136 (Tax levied on the 65,421.40 dividends that are taxable, combination of the different tax bracket rates on HMRC website.) =67,785.40 (Income you receive after tax)<p>So on £105,000.00 of earned income as a freelancer you end up paying £30,654.60 of income taxation (Corporation and Personal tax).<p>If you were a normal salaried employee you would pay £31,696.40 on £105,000 salary. (www.listentotaxman.com)<p>So I would argue it is hardly tax avoidance and if I take into account the risk I take as a freelancer then I am hardly working through a UK Ltd company to avoid tax. Most people still believe that the same rules of the 90&#x27;s apply to UK ltd companies and freelancing but it is simply not the case.<p>Please do check the above with your accountant to confirm as this is not financial advise and I am not an accountant. However there are really not many options for avoiding paying tax as a UK freelancer. Keep in mind that the £5k dividend tax free allowance is also being reduced to only £2k from 2018 onward.","time":1510153436,"type":"comment"}

I did, however, give a lightning talk at the 31C3 (the recording is in the pinned tweet on the Twitter account, if you&#x27;re interested).<p>4) How is that &quot;unfair&quot;?<p>Everything you do you do because of some sort of motivation.

Can you please talk more about this?<p>&gt; This forum is not going to be fast for millions of users (it might not even be for hundreds of simultaneous users) because the server has to render everything again for everyone.<p>This theory doesn&#x27;t match reality. In reality, multipage applications are faster than single-page ones. In fact, most things on the internet still are multipage, including web forums. Most web forums are powered by PHPBB, a multipage web app, and they were powered by PHPBB 15 years ago, when hardware and PHP were much slower. This very site is a multipage web app, and it holds up just fine, even though it has enough users to bring down other websites.<p>Single-page applications seemed like they would be faster, but usually they aren&#x27;t.<p>First, let&#x27;s look closer at a multipage application. All of the scripts, styles, and images should be cached after loading the first page, if you set the headers right (the Expires header, mainly). Therefore, what is left? The content. And I have found that the size of the HTML content is often close to the size of the same thing in JSON --- at least the way I write HTML (I try to keep it lean. Few classes, extraneous divs, etc.). This is because JSON has all those keys:<p><pre><code>    {\n        &quot;color&quot;: &quot;red&quot;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nwhile HTML has just the values:<p><pre><code>    &lt;div&gt;red&lt;&#x2F;div&gt;\n</code></pre>\nThat was a simple example, but I measured a bigger one, and the size turned out to be about the same, especially after compression. All of those HTML tags compress well, because of repetition.<p>Now if they are the same size, then they should load in the same time. Except they don&#x27;t. The server-rendered page loads faster. Why? Because of progressive rendering. When just some of the HTML has come down the pipe, the page appears. But with AJAX, all of the JSON must first load, then be parsed, then wrapped in a template, then inserted into the DOM. Then it appears all at once.","time":1510156535,"type":"comment"}

Within the past year or so I did end up doing some fundraising for the project which did turn into a marketing heavy endeavor (videos&#x2F;marketing only email lists&#x2F;update posts targeting users&#x2F;long replies to email or forums&#x2F;etc). Some of the marketing emails were fun to show off new features, but they did eat a fair amount of time when they were coming out at a reasonable pace. Outside of that one time period the application receives most of its marketing from independent interested users and release announcements.<p>per the questions:<p>&gt; 1) why did you start it?<p>I took over as a maintainer when I wanted to use the application and bugs&#x2F;missing features were an issue (IIRC it was without a maintainer for ~3 years).<p>&gt; 2) how did people find it?<p>Originally the project was marketed via mailing lists&#x2F;forums&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;software review sites&#x2F;early youtube or pre-youtube videos&#x2F;etc. After a few years it ended up being presented in an open source community conference. Currently a fair amount of web traffic comes from a few freeware review sites in addition to the general linux community which is spread over a larger variety of sites (and more difficult to pinpoint as most users are going to obtain copies from their package manager rather than the website).<p>&gt; 3) did you post it somewhere to get traction?<p>The releases are posted to 2 forums, 2 mailing lists. It&#x27;s original release was only posted to a single audio based mailing list (AFAIK).\nWhen working on fundraising bits were posted to 2 different other mailing lists and information was provided to 3 software review sites, one of which posted the information provided.<p>&gt; 4) do you think it&#x27;s unfair to just work on something you like but never take the time to get the word out?<p>Nope. You&#x27;re spending your time working on something. If your goals align with having other people utilize your work, then by all means talk about it, otherwise there&#x27;s no problem whatsoever with keeping it to yourself. Also consider that marketing for contributors and marketing for users are two (sometimes different) activities.","time":1510157869,"type":"comment"}

There is a way, but it isn&#x27;t simple.<p>For American citizens, offshore company&#x27;s primary benefit are:<p>- protect trade secrets or initiate transactions without showing your hand to the market<p>- to deter creditors (as long as they aren&#x27;t the US Government) as it raises the bar for them to find those assets and sue it and get a judgement and collect on that judgement<p>- segregated assets. Some jurisdictions offer entity structures which are very immature in the United States or haven&#x27;t caught on yet. The Series LLC exists in a handful of US states but may lack case law, Segregated Portfolio Companies exist in other places like the British Virgin Islands and may have more case law or better statutory conditions.<p>- deal with more international clientele. Many times there are parallel US laws specifically for offshore clientele. For investors its the difference between Reg D and Reg S, I had one other example but I forgot it.","time":1510160403,"type":"comment"}

Here&#x27;s a brief list:<p>* They post all the content themselves under their own name, until other people start joining. It&#x27;s not elegant and may not look great at first, but it&#x27;s worked before.<p>* Fake accounts are used, with the founder(s) pretending to be a number of individuals. Said fake accounts usually get retired as the site gets more popular (for real).<p>* Previous friends or contacts are involved. Perhaps they run a company and everyone employed is told to post, maybe they&#x27;re a celebrity with a fanbase, you know the drill.<p>* Influencer marketing is used. In other words, they try and incentivise celebrities and popular figures to use the site, assuming their fanbase will follow.<p>* Promotion sites or services are another option, with a few admins doing &#x27;exchanges&#x27; for a bit of extra activity. So you go up to someone else running a similar site, and say that if they post on your site, you&#x27;ll post on theirs for a while.<p>* They could also just pay people to post. You can hire random freelancers to post content if you&#x27;re desperate, or use a paid service where people earn money for signing up and posting X amount of content on so many sites.<p>* If they&#x27;re really interested in morally dubious tactics, they can also use tools that imports content from third party sites en masse. Seen a few do this with Yahoo Answers, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this stuff existed for other services too.<p>* They could also buy another site (or twenty) and merge them in to get the appearance of a large community. Seen that happen a lot with tech and gaming sites.<p>* Finally, they could always just directly incentivise people to join by say, offering money to whoever posts X amount of content or refers lots of new users.<p>Really, it depends on the site in question.

You are correct, I did not include them in the personal income you receive as I have created the example in the way you would do your tax return calculation. So the expenses are deducted from your company profit before tax as it is your company that is incurring the expenses.<p>You do get reimbursed for those expenses if you make them via your own credit or debit card, otherwise if you use a company card for them you will never have that money touch your own bank account. I do agree that you benefit from being able to use &quot;before tax&quot; money to pay for some of your expenses.<p>The tricky thing about expenses is that not everything is allowed to be deducted as an expense. If for example you take your client out for a meal and a few drinks and you account for that as Business Entertaining, that amount is not eligible for tax relief and thus you cannot deduct that from your profits to reduce your company&#x27;s taxable income. It will then get taxed at the company level.<p>What I am trying to show is that the argument that Freelancers in the UK &quot;avoid&quot; paying tax compared to permanent employees is not true anymore. Yes we do have the ability to plan our tax better. However there seems to be this idea from permanent employees that freelancers are paying only 10% income tax when that really is not the case. There is a slight benefit, and from the above example a little more than £1000. Obviously there are other options and scenarios with spouses being made directors of the company etc. But it is hardly reducing your tax to the 7% achieved by Apple.<p>One also takes a lot bigger risk since personal injury, illness and non-paying clients do have the ability to derail your earnings in a really big way. If you get the flu and are out for a week that hurts. Or heaven forbid you have an accident and are unable to work for a few months while recovering.<p>Most of the freelancers I know do it because of the freedom and flexibility they get out of it, not because there are substantial tax advantages.<p>I would be very interested to hear your thoughts after you have run the numbers yourself.","time":1510165914,"type":"comment"}

That you can do something (within the law) or that no moral outrage would occur is itself not a measure of ethical action.<p>Not dealing harm is itself a rather weak ethical stance. Ethics doesn&#x27;t test whether you do no harm, it tests whether you maximized the good -- and not the good for you or your investors, but rather the good across all of society.<p>If anyone holds you to an obligation that entails that you take an unethical action then such a license itself become immediately void. We can see this historically expressed by St. Augustine in the 3rd century and more recently by Martin Luther King Jr. (an unjust law is no law).<p>Hence, the law itself is not a measure of ethical act. That you _can_ do something is not itself a justification of ethical action. Only that you _should_ do something is itself a measure of ethics. In which case you must provide proof that you _should_ misrepresent yourself and your content. Returning to Kant. If you cannot universalize the action -- that is to say, if you cannot show that to create fake content is always a good act (and with all the rufus about &quot;Fake news,&quot; I think we certainly cannot show that fake content has been universally good).<p>Jumping into the question of net good we skip from deontology to utilitarianism. Yet, utilitarianism recognizes that net good is not a measure of money, or pleasure but can be an abstract measurement. Success of the business is only a local consideration, you must expand the ethical question to all of society. That which is good for you or your investors is not itself a net good for society (nor from a deontological perspective a good unto itself).<p>Was the success of Reddit a net positive for society? Had there been no Reddit would our net quality of life have been improved as a whole society. In this, I would say Reddit was not a net positive for society. It consolidated a distributed system of smaller social forums across the internet into a single hegemonic gated community and consolidating social power into a smaller sum of hands. And I would argue that consolidation of power into smaller groups (whether hard or soft power and in this case we are discussing the soft power of cultural norms) is itself unethical.","time":1510167287,"type":"comment"}

I&#x27;m not even sure why precedents work, given that there&#x27;s no &quot;case&quot; here.<p>Your misplaced cynicism about moral outrage becomes more obvious if you replace tax evasion with something much worse, e.g. child labour or human trafficking, something which is in fact prevalent, though probably not within Apple&#x27;s sphere. But the moral outrage exists because these papers expose something so blatantly immoral that people are genuinely surprised and dismayed at the sheer scale at which rich companies and people are stockpiling money in secret. We know human trafficking occurs every day, all over the world; if someone uncovers a big network of, say, politicans involved in this trafficking, aren&#x27;t we right to be outraged? Is it a &quot;failure to see the world for what it is&quot; just because it&#x27;s accepted that evil things happen? How blasé can one get?<p>Re &quot;don&#x27;t you think they are entitled to try to save as much of it as they can?&quot;, this confuses morality with legality. As David Mitchell eloquently points out [1], the current systems are effectively a tax on conscience. Taxes are traditionally designed to incentivize good behaviour (e.g. tax breaks on saved pensions, because that benefits both you and society), but the system currently incentivizes bad behaviour among the select few who have the means and lack of scruples to do it, penalizing those who lack the means and are conscientious about their taxes.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xc8epam4NyY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xc8epam4NyY</a>","time":1510170793,"type":"comment"}

Datalog made it trivial to jump arbitrarily through any relationship. And transactor functions were trivial to write at a time when I had never written a Postgres trigger function.<p>I didn&#x27;t apply much professional due process here because I looked at my forum rewrite as a hobby project. It&#x27;s not like I was being paid.<p>However, over the course of that year, my forum suffered due to my hobby-level understanding of Datomic.<p>For example, I had the forum application, the Datomic transactor, and the Datomic client running on one Linode machine. I told myself I&#x27;d figure out how to host Datomic on AWS in the future, but of course that never happened.<p>As the forum grew in size, I started dreading restarting my application because the Datomic client would have to sync with the database. It started to take many minutes. And I didn&#x27;t have enough information to know why -- is this just I&#x2F;O limitations of loading info into the process? Or was the fact that hundreds of users were F5&#x27;ing the server? I never made myself a real deploy system either. I would manually ssh in, `tmux a`, `git pull`, and manually restart my processes. Very amateurish, but it was so easy to say that I&#x27;d fix it in the future.<p>I also made mistakes like having zero insight into my application. My application was growing slower over time, but I didn&#x27;t know why. I had some really slow database queries and I was still using LIMIT&#x2F;OFFSET for pagination at this time.<p>I also found out that Datomic isn&#x27;t made for massive blocks of text like forum posts. When I saw that Datomic had full-text search, I assumed that meant otherwise.<p>A year went by and I started to get stressed out about the forum. I had this crippling guilt that I even tried to build a forum from scratch instead of just using Xenforo. Felt bad for my users who were hanging in there or just leaving out of frustration.<p>One of the reasons I rolled my own forum aside from thinking that it would be easy was that it would also be cheaper.

By my hand-rolled forum cost 1&#x2F;5th of that, so at least I had that going for me.<p>During all this, I started working with a friend on a different project and he refused to use Clojure. We ended up with Node + Postgres and he was a Postgres pro who I learned a lot from.<p>Before long, I had a full Node + Postgres application under my belt and decided to rewrite my Clojure + Datomic forum. I could have swapped out Datomic for Postgres instead of throwing the baby away with the bathwater, but I wasn&#x27;t convinced that that would be any less work.<p>I also decided to host my rewrite on Heroku this time to force myself to rewrite the forum in a more stateless way. For example, my Clojure forum had a hard dependency on the filesystem. Not to mention having the database on the same machine meant I&#x27;d never be able to spin up another application server.<p>Of course, any time you rewrite something, you have the opportunity to fix your legacy mistakes from day one which I did. For example, I finally optimized pagination away from LIMIT&#x2F;OFFSET. I got to clean up a lot of cruft. I also used RDS for Postgres which solved all my database problems. I really had no business using Datomic since I had such a weak understanding of its trade-offs.","time":1510173845,"type":"comment"}

Building more than one version of given infrastructure is often called an &quot;overbuild&quot; and it tends to be bad. Like you don&#x27;t have two different electric, gas or water companies running a whole set of wires, poles, pipes or whatever to your house. The capex cost of any such network is massive so paying that cost 2, 3 or 4 times for the same number of customers is clearly going to more costly for consumers overall.<p>2. Utilities, which aren&#x27;t duplicated, are heavily regulated to avoid monopolistic behaviour as this is the only rational choice. I believe in the US this is Title II for telecommunications at least (which covers landline service). The FCC under the Obama administration did follow through with a promise to apply Title II to ISPs as well, something Comcat, TWC and the like were deadset against as it would obviously impact profits.<p>The real problem here is that Internet at this point is really the fourth utility and it should be legislated and regulated as such but Comcat et al don&#x27;t just want to be &quot;dumb pipes&quot;.<p>This factors into the whole net neutrality argument too. Imagine PG&amp;E said that you could only use electricity for Whirlpool branded washers and dryers or if you used anything else the electricity would cost you more. Well, that kind of discrimination is what US ISPs want to be able to do (sadly) and we&#x27;ve already seen this with, say, Verizon throttling Netflix traffic.<p>3. ISPs have unfortunately been much better at framing these public debates than the other side. For example, in the aforementioned net neutrality debates, ISPs framed this as the likes of Netflix pushing data onto their network for free and they argued they should get paid for that.<p>The reality is of course that Netflix doesn&#x27;t push anything. Consumers are pulling data from Netflix. ISPs are getting paid for this too... by the consumers. The ISPs are simply trying to double-dip and get paid at both ends. What&#x27;s more, stiffling services like Netflix has nothing to do with any notion of fairness. It&#x27;s just a backhanded way of cable companies propping up their declining TV businesses.<p>4. Various other models have been tried around the world to solve the overbuild problem. In Australia, for example, the government has tried a strategy where a single entity would own the wires and ISPs could rent those lines to provide services to consumers. To make this work, the entity owning the wires has to charge the same price to everyone, no matter how big or small.<p>Unfortunately, for a bunch of complicated reasons to NBN (so-called &quot;next generation&quot; broadband network) is going to end up only guaranteeing 12Mbps to each household... in 2017 for probably A$60-70B for a country of ~24M.<p>5. Building any sort of netowrk like this is what I like to call a national hyperlocal business and the entrenched players are very good at it. To give some examples:<p>- Getting access to poles varies from city to city and can be hugely complicated;<p>- Digging trenches can be just as complicated and you might have to deal with a bunch of different stuff in the ground (eg one area has a ton of limestone in the soil).<p>- Existing buildings once had single-vendor agreements that prohibited new players from providing service there. At one point these were ruled illegal. They&#x27;ve since been replaced by exclusive marketing agreements where, say, a condo building will only ever tell you about one provider.<p>- Once you&#x27;ve built past a lot of houses it still requires a lot of efforts to connect a new house (we&#x27;re talking hours). There is a huge manpower component in this. To be already connected to an existing provider is a huge advantage to that existing provider.<p>6. No discussion of cable companies in the US is complete without touching on the issue of franchise agreements. A franchise agreement is where a cable company agreed to build in a given city and to alleviate the expense they were offered a number of benefits. These could be exclusive rights, ownership of the poles and so on. But to provide TV service, the company usually ended up paying the town. These sums could be significant to the budgets of the towns or counties in which they applied. These fees also discouraged the municipality from being friendly to any newcomer as any such newcomer may mean a budget hit.<p>Disclaimer: I used to work on Google Fiber.","time":1510174092,"type":"comment"}

But those problems could have been solved by regulating profit-taking so that profits can only be taken as a proportion of investment.<p>OpenReach offer both local-loop-unbundling (IPSs put equipment in BT exchanges and handle backhaul themselves, and get a raw copper or fibre connection to the subscriber) and backhaul where ISPs connect to BT one or more places and get a raw IP connection to the subscriber.<p>It works ok, with the caveat above, and it also doesn&#x27;t stop alternatives, like FTTP from other providers, in areas where it is economically viable to lay new networks.","time":1510175261,"type":"comment"}

But the government can subsidize those people specifically, or build municipal networks in those areas. Better to do that than to distort the entire market by requiring every telecom provider to basically run a public service arm. That ensures only mega-corps can afford to get into the businsss.<p>It’s illustrative to look at what Stockholm did. A municipal entity built the dark fiber, but it was not subsidized. Nor was it subject to any build out requirement or mandatory cross subsidies. The entity built out based on demand, targeting businesses first. The resulting service is actually pretty expensive (about $130 for gigabit, plus a fee for building the fiber if necessary). For rural areas, the government simply gave a tax subsidy for rural residents to pay to wire themselves with fiber.<p>I’ll also note that we don’t build other kinds of utilities this way either! If there isn’t sufficient demand for sewer or water, a water utility simply doesn’t build it.

I see that there are a small number of API endpoints that you&#x27;ve marked &quot;public&quot; that users are meant to be able to reach. In practice, the user&#x27;s POSTs would always be terminated upstream from the AuthN server itself, either at a gateway or by just relaying the requests through from the front-end servers themselves. A service that&#x27;s part public&#x2F;part private is much more perilous than a service that is one or the other. All things considered, these public endpoints seem like a very minor convenience to the integrator. I would just make the AuthN API private, and ask users to implement the public endpoints themselves by making requests to the AuthN API.<p>If you DID make all endpoints private, you&#x27;re no longer tied to HTTP, and you have a nice opportunity to use GRPC instead. I&#x27;ve recently started rolling it out in my own services, and it&#x27;s unexpectedly great considering the track-record of similar ideas.

When have you ever seen a situation where a micro service was accessed over the network to fetch something that would have been in L1 cache? And yes, having a value &quot;in memory&quot; is faster, but in most cases these days things aren&#x27;t &quot;in memory&quot;, they&#x27;re &quot;in memory in memcached, somewhere in the cluster, probably not on the local server so you have to go over the network anyway&quot;.<p>Just out of curiosity though, I tested on our network. Our RTT between servers is less than half a millisecond. Our fastest service can get a cached reply back to the calling service in 35ms, whereas many calls are &gt;100ms and some are much longer (e.g. initial login calls). It would take a lot of external login calls to noticeably (to the user) increase even the fastest service.<p>We also use Redis and memcached, and spread those across other services. Excluding specifically HTTP overhead and just looking at network latency, a few memcached calls which hit non-local servers in the cluster cost us as much in latency as one HTTP call would.","time":1510180940,"type":"comment"}

So the similitude with Bitcoin would be with the added coins in one year. \nJust for some reference.

A deflationary currency like bitcoin would have to grow in unit value accordingly because of its cap, if it were to become the de-facto new gold standard. How much power consumption is appropriate for mining needs to be considered in relative terms vs how much mower hungry is gold mining, for example. I am not sure how power hungry is printing and managing cash (incl. security, transport...). \nAlso, all these activities (gold mining, bitcoin mining, cash printing) also contribute to GDP. Eventually if the power source is renewable and generation capacity is kept at appropriate level (e.g no one dies of cold because power must be prioritized to mining) does it matter?

There is a reasonable interpretation of &quot;free&quot; for which the BSD license may be considered to offer more freedom to users than the GPL. Most importantly, it comes with less obligations.

It&#x27;s like comparing watts versus KWh, or your annual income with your bank balance. But there&#x27;s a bigger mistake here.<p>The point of the economy is to create value for humans. There is plenty of non-value-creating activity that can be denominated in dollar terms, but that doesn&#x27;t make it actually valuable. For example, this season&#x27;s hurricanes will cause something like $200bn in economic activity. But that doesn&#x27;t mean we should have more hurricanes. [1] People bet at least tens of billions annually on sports, but getting people to double or triple that doesn&#x27;t actually make anybody richer. Similarly, Bitcoin is only a true economic positive to the extent that it actually creates new value for humans.<p>If Bill Gates went on a Bitcoin buying spree, he could easily drive the nominal market cap way up. But we&#x27;d have no more economic value in the world. If Bitcoin enthusiasts got bored and turned off all the servers, we&#x27;d have little less economic value in the world. That&#x27;s because most Bitcoin use is not economically productive. Most of it is, like gambling, just moving existing economic value around between people.<p>I go on at length like this because it&#x27;s vital that startup people understand the difference between creating value and just shuffling who controls existing value. Only the former is sustainable.<p>[1] To think otherwise is the broken window fallacy: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Parable_of_the_broken_window\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Parable_of_the_broken_window</a>","time":1510186063,"type":"comment"}

That&#x27;s what it is.<p>The idea of an identity, especially a permanent one that travels with you throughout your life, is a relative recent one. 200 years ago, you could escape your past sins, so long as you didn&#x27;t have an identifiable face and could speak the language at your destination. (If you couldn&#x27;t you ran the very real risk of becoming a slave, which is caused by removing a person from their context; e.g. family, language and community).<p>There is a deeper question of &quot;What is an identity?&quot; and we also have to realize that the digital identities have never existed throughout history. Not in the way they do today. It&#x27;s hard for us to imagine a world before passports, before real borders and before permanent numbers and documents that follow citizens throughout their lives.<p>And the principal reason we have digital identities today? Debt. It is solely to trace debt. It has nothing to do with proving you went to x university or worked at y job. There are other ways to track that, which are terribly inaccurate when you really start to look at them. The principal reason for your SSN, your digital identity, is to track credit and debt. I highly recommend the book _Debt: The First 5,000 Years_. It really goes into depth on this concept.","time":1510188609,"type":"comment"}

We chose arbitrarily to set the limit to 4 million segwit weight units, however it could be changed to anything without impacting energy consumption.<p>It&#x27;s at least <i>partly</i> a technical limit, because there are technical issues faced by scaling the Bitcoin network to the arbitrarily large number of transactions&#x2F;sec you think it can handle.  Each scaling solution has its tradeoffs[1][3], and therefore, to the extent that there&#x27;s no &quot;free [scaling] lunch&quot;, then there is inherent scarcity to what the miners can support, and therefore transactions <i>should be</i> attributed their proportional share of that limit when accounting for them.<p>It only appears as a political limit because a) users generally don&#x27;t want a fragmented network, and b) there&#x27;s persistent disagreement on what tradeoffs are acceptable when scaling.<p>&gt;Therefore your analogy is incorrect: if the cargo capacity of a truck is increased, it will certainly impact its fuel consumption.<p>What is that responding to?

That&#x27;s not the case.<p>Here in Brazil, the main ID is the RG (Registro Geral), which is an identity card made of paper, issued by any of the 26 states (plus the Federal District). Since it&#x27;s issued by the states, a single person can have more than one RG.<p>We also have the equivalent of USA&#x27;s SSN, here called the CPF. Like the SSN, it&#x27;s used as the person&#x27;s tax ID, and is a national number. It&#x27;s also issued as a card made of paper, but unlike the RG, it cannot be used for identification, since it has no picture or fingerprint. For simplicity, if you already have a CPF number when your RG is issued (or re-issued), you can have the CPF number printed on the RG card.<p>It&#x27;s with the CPF that the &quot;Infraestrutura de Chaves Públicas&quot; (ICP) comes into view: you can get a certificate associated with your CPF, and use it for instance to sign your taxes. But it&#x27;s not required, and most people don&#x27;t have that certificate, or even know that it exists.<p>In my opinion, the reason we don&#x27;t have the same problem as the USA is not some fancy digital certificate stuff, but the simple fact that the CPF number by itself does nothing: everybody also wants to see the RG card. And for income taxes, the electronic form also requires a number found in the previous year&#x27;s income tax receipt. The income tax return will be deposited into a bank account of your choice, but AFAIK it only accepts a bank account where the account owner has the same CPF, and to open a bank account you need the RG (plus other documents).","time":1510190882,"type":"comment"}

You are penalized if you use too much of your available credit. You are also penalized if you use too little of it, as I found out when I paid off the balance of the one remaining card that held a balance, and saw my credit score hit by about 15 points shortly thereafter. There are other rules, too.<p>Basically, I can only conclude that we are encouraged to be &#x27;good citizens&quot; by borrowing money and paying interest on it while slowly paying back the principal. People who live on a cash-only basis, which was considered to be a respectable practice not that long ago (borrowing was shameful) have <i>terrible</i> credit scores.<p>So what, you may ask?<p>There are very real and increasing disincentives to having bad or no credit.

Divide network hashrate into how much power the most efficient ASICs use, and I don’t think it’s an unfair estimate. You can’t dismiss the argument that maybe we can do better as “naysaying,” nor that there is something about cryptocurrency that the people making the argument do not understand. How many joules go into making a bitcoin block? (Really, I’m curious.)<p>It doesn’t take the entire output of a coal-fired generator to handle trillions in trade volume on traditional exchanges. Minting coins doesn’t require an entire nuclear plant dedicated to it. Even for newfangled cryptocurrency, the human race can handle a hundredish billion dollar market cap without using <i>that</i> much energy. It’s incredibly wasteful and destructive to our planet. How do you think the Chinese are throwing cheap electricity at all that mining gear? Provinces covered in solar panels? (For that matter, how do you think the <i>Americans</i> are?)<p>Literally the entire concept of mining is brute force through the SHA2 problem space for <i>nothing</i> (to create the currency of <i>value</i>; nobody is saying bitcoin is worthless). Imagine if, instead, you dumped that energy into storage or even useful computation (again: proof of work, not the currency, is useless computation), and what you could do with it. There needs to be acknowledgment that brute force cryptographic hashing is a pretty serious design flaw. We just happen to be working around it now that bitcoin is a Big Deal.<p>To drive this home, Bitfury is building out 30+ MW mining facilities that require immersion cooling in 3M Novec, because state-of-the-art datacenter CRACs aren’t capable of rejecting waste heat from that kind of power density. We are talking 150+ kW cabinet-equivalents, where anything over 15-20 kW per cabinet with CRAC is currently considered noteworthy. AIUI, they have to underclock their gear when relying on datacenter air. Two-phase immersion is a cool, efficient technology that will probably reimagine the datacenter and should be developed further, but machine learning and science workloads are barely starting to crack that nut. Bitcoin ran directly to the front of the line of “incredibly power-intensive workloads that we haven’t encountered in datacenter design before.” That’s good and bad.","time":1510194053,"type":"comment"}

Same with public transit and road systems their employees will use.

Perhaps car leasing is another loan people might take but that works similar way.<p>Borrowing money to buy everything seems to be an American fetish (but also present in U.K. which is most America like part of Europe and Asia, not continental Europe though). It always seemed insane to me to have to borrow money from bank to buy a latte or groceries.","time":1510195714,"type":"comment"}

Even though every other company on planet earth can do that.<p>Ex: The Government of Ontario issues three different kinds of ID. The &#x27;Health Care&#x27; ID cannot be used as valid ID anywhere else, only within health. There are huge bureaucracies dedicated to each form of ID. Why not issue one ID, and all of the agencies can use that? Answer: unions and job protectionism. I personally know the former CEO of &#x27;Services Ontario&#x27; - he has no interest in increasing quality of service - there is absolutely zero incentive for him. Moreover - the Unions would make it quite impossible. Why would he even consider automating tasks when it reduces headcount? The union will put up a stink and it could get him fired. Moreover, he loses budget and power. So the incentives are completely upside down for most government agencies.<p>Ex: The TTC (Toronto Public Transit) pays many of it&#x27;s staff quite a lot. Toronto really needs Subway extensions, which are massively expensive to the point we can&#x27;t afford them = yet we are still paying people to collect change - as I mentioned above, some of them earn over $100K.<p>Ex: try visiting stats Canada right now:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statcan.gc.ca&#x2F;eng&#x2F;start\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statcan.gc.ca&#x2F;eng&#x2F;start</a><p>try making sense of that mess - there&#x27;s tons and tons of data, most of it poorly organized, de-facto unsearchable. Very poorly presented when it is. Moreover - it&#x27;s 2017 and up until a month ago NONE of the data was available via API (!!!). Just one month ago, they made <i>some</i> of it available. Of course, most of the data is not useful, they&#x27;re not collecting some of the most relevant information that we need - specifically demographic information by postal code etc..<p>Can you imagine if Google quality engineers were responsible for the search and presentation of that data?<p>Ex: the Ontario Police (OPP) made a deal with the government such that they had to be the &#x27;highest paid police&#x27; in the Province. So a local village, called &#x27;Shelburne&#x27; Ontario, with 2 cops, for some reason of local dispute, decide to pay their 2 guys massively over the regular wage for a cop. Guess what: OPP unions take the government to task for insanely high wages. Meanwhile, there are budget cuts everywhere.<p>Ex: The Toronto Community housing rakes in $200-400 million dollars a year from city taxpayers - and almost 50% of that is spent on <i>overhead</i> and administration! So $100-100M just on <i>staffing</i> and other things. You do realize if this were a charity, it would be considered &#x27;corrupt&#x27;? Moreover, the idea that governments should be building homes? Why are they doing that? If we are interested in having low income people live in specific area (one might ask the question why?) - then why wouldn&#x27;t we just literally subsidize housing for them? Let them live where they please in that area and they will pay landlords&#x2F;developer just as any other person. Government managers who so inefficiently spend 50% of their charitable budgets on overhead are somehow going to be able to hire contracts and manage building more efficiently than the private sector? No.<p>Ex: Parole officers in corrections Canada us FAX MACHINES when individuals need to request their various forms of leave. Why? &#x27;Paper Trail&#x27;. So they say (And its not due to signatures). But they can&#x27;t grasp using email, or some kind of portal for this. Because why should they?<p>What reason do these agencies have to change? Regular voters cannot really vote on these specific things - mostly we don&#x27;t know they are happening.<p>If there is no reason for a system to change - or system incentives are set up to create more workers and less efficiency - well - that&#x27;s what will happen.<p>It&#x27;s all just bureaucracy absurdism.<p>Governments are needed for regulation, and they might need to operate specific things (i.e. roads, the power lines but not power plants, wireless spectrum, military) and of course Health is always a special case.<p>Teaching is one of those areas public schools can do well - because it&#x27;s almost impossible to screw up: put a well educated, decent person in a room in front of a class with teaching plans and books and you have a school. It&#x27;s not like the school can go 500% over budget. And there aren&#x27;t really many ways to improve on it, as I don&#x27;t believe that competitive bonuses actually improve teaching quality that much.<p>But otherwise, no. It&#x27;s mostly just a massive form of distribution of surpluses.","time":1510196587,"type":"comment"}

Power consumption. Bram brought up a good point if we take Bitcoin to its ultimate extreme, that it will be people with access to nuclear energy (aka governments) that will take over mining bitcoin, since that is the cheapest route. This does not look like a decentralized future, exactly the opposite.<p>2. Proof of Time. There are attacks that can happen against purely storage based proofs. Bram&#x27;s brilliant addition here is a proof of time to get around those problems. I can explain more if people want. NOTE: Filecoin&#x27;s &quot;Proof of Time and Space&quot; has nothing to do with, nor is remotely related to, Bram&#x27;s.<p>3. Decentralized Storage. Despite Bram&#x27;s prolific work in decentralized storage systems, Chia has nothing to do with storing end user data (like Storj, Sia, Maidsafe, etc.). The data that is stored is junk, but that is okay (see below).<p>4. Storage waste. One of Bram&#x27;s points is that this will start an arms race to build better harddrives. If people are successful at that, this will only make Chia better, and also make storage in general cheaper for everyone. So sure, maybe the proofs are wasting storage space, but it will make storage in general more economical.<p>Anything else I can answer in more detail?<p></i>Here is the presentation he (and I) did at Berkeley:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;BerkeleyBlockchain&#x2F;videos&#x2F;2006069823011271\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;BerkeleyBlockchain&#x2F;videos&#x2F;200606982...</a>","time":1510199402,"type":"comment"}

The initial work in establishing trust is annoying, but verifying identity once you have some system in place is easy enough. A short phone or video call with someone who _did_ know you and works within the same institution would be a pretty sufficient way to go about it.

JASON APIs are less expensive to get generate than full HTML pages which include the same content. It might only be a fraction less work on the servers but multiply that by several hundred thousand and you quickly enable yourself to scale down your back end infrastructure.<p>This isn&#x27;t stuff I&#x27;m blindly guessing on either, I&#x27;ve worked on several hugely busy UK and international services that started out as monolithic code bases pushing HTML and migrated them to APIs. Each time the language remained the same, the main body of the backend logic even remained the same, but instead of pulling HTML templated from the backend and pushing out the completed contents, the move was to push out the templates and have the client side render them. Each time that change was made the back end infrastructure could shrink. In some instances by a factor of <i>10</i>!! The drawback is the client side took longer to render the page upon first impression, however the application ran faster from then on in and the hosting costs were reduced as well.<p>So this is why I keep saying scale matters when discussing APIs Vs server side HTML generation.

I&#x27;m not an expert in this area, but a few examples I know of:<p>- In the UK, Visa&#x2F;Mastercard are the most common networks used for bank debit cards, using them pulls money from your bank account directly. Most banks give most adults (citation needed, but I think) a debit card by default with an account.<p>- In the UK, you can apply for credit cards from a number of companies, including banks (but it&#x27;s a seperate to any bank account you might have with them), and credit card only companies. Different providers offer different types of cards, and the kind of deal you can get will depend on your credit history, salary, etc. They will (nearly always) have a credit limit, which could be a few hundred or could be very large. They will have a specific rule about minimum payments - some might want your balance paid in full each month, others will ask for a minimum payment (which could be a tiny percent of the amount owed) each month. If you pay in full, you don&#x27;t get charged interest. If you take longer to pay, but within the agreed terms, you&#x27;ll pay some sort of interest, which could be reasonable or extremely expensive depending on the card you have. Some cards offer benefits (points or cashback, maybe other perks like special deals, concierge services, etc.) while some are purely lines of credit with no other benefits.<p>- In France, I was given a Visa debit card when opening a standard bank account. No experience with French credit cards.<p>- In Belgium, if you want a card on the Visa&#x2F;Mastercard networks, you need to get a credit card - most people use debit cards which use different networks (I think they use Maestro and another one..)","time":1510225119,"type":"comment"}

What&#x27;s the message here, bullying someone for having lost her father is okay, not having a father is not okay? That&#x27;s normalizing people being bullied for being humans.

That need comes from being someone, at least the natural initial desire to become someone, and it aims at people who are someone, too.<p>&gt; Ethics is not black and white.<p>Except of course for the father figure she &quot;obviously&quot; needs, and how the confidence has &quot;improved&quot; (implied: from not good enough to good enough), during that &quot;critical&quot; part of the development as if there were any non-critical ones in life.<p>&gt; O righteous crusaders for truth, if this girl was put in front of you, would you tell her?<p>That&#x27;s not the question. The question is, would you fake being her father, or would you hire a fake father, and the answer to both of that for me is no, I can bet you my life on that, in writing. Oh righteous crusader for deep considerations, can you at least not turn faking being a father into the burden of &quot;telling the truth&quot; in a situation we would not have incurred in the first place?<p>When something makes you sad, there is usually good reason for it. Why not simply give her drugs to make her happy, and money to make it not matter if she has a career? If truthfulness, who you actually are, is just this thing on the side trumped by &quot;outcome&quot;, why arbitrarily stop there? Why not permanently install on VR helmets and drug pumps onto everybody right after birth, done?<p>What would people who don&#x27;t mind something like this have to withstand something even more twisted? How about this is already 20 iterations past sane, how about no? How about having a decent society instead of a rising tide of shut-ins and suicide and elderly people with plastic robot dogs? If you can&#x27;t see those elephants on the couch, how can you be all life coach about this maybe not being the sad, nutty thing it is on the surface because it&#x27;s <i>possible</i> that in 20 years it might have turned out well? Start everything like you want it to end. If you can&#x27;t handle even someone else&#x27;s mortality, how about your own? When I worked in a hospital, I was constantly amazed at the idle chit chat relatives made with people who had very short time left. I felt like those of the stuff who made human connections were the only ones remotely realizing what was going on. The visitors just dipped in, coated in a shell of activity, and left before anything could sink in. And I believe many genuinely loved those they visited, for some they were the apple of their eye; they were just so <i>inept at life</i> that they wasted those last moments together, too. In short, just to repeat, no. No to all of it. No to that entire branch.<p>edit: while I don&#x27;t like to add even more to such a long rant (please don&#x27;t take it personal in the accusative sense because I mirrored your &quot;oh..&quot; phrasing, take it as personal as meaning a lot to me), another thought occurred to me that actually does make me a bit angry: he&#x27;s not &quot;giving&quot; her a fake father, he&#x27;s taking her real and unfortunately dead father away from her. In the sense of role models and emotional support a LOT of things and people can do -- in the sense of the person you are and who your parents are, there are no substitutes. This is unforgivable to me; not that it&#x27;s my call in this case, but if I was that girl, and I found out one day, that guy would have to fear for his life. How is it even possible that it&#x27;s legal for him to not own up when she turns 18? Just because the lie started when she wasn&#x27;t an adult? There is not one single aspect of this that isn&#x27;t utterly fucked up to me. No, it&#x27;s not understandable. It&#x27;s understandable as in you needed to clean the dishes and now there is a 100 m tall sea monster destroying the whole block.","time":1510234128,"type":"comment"}

Some will become serious issues in the next few years.<p>Credit scores are basically an estimate of credit-worthiness. The system is designed to solve the banks&#x27; problems, not consumers&#x27;. For banks, some number of false positives (creditworthy person with a bad score) is acceptable. It may narrow the market slightly, but it improves the quality of the remaining majority of customers.<p>This is true of a lot of statistical&#x2F;algorithmic decision making. Paypal flagged me as &quot;high risk&quot; when I moved countries, so I can&#x27;t use paypal now. For paypal, losing 1 of me to avoid 2 malicious users is an acceptable trade-off. For me, it&#x27;s annoying but not a big deal because paypal is rarely the only option.<p>If paypal&#x27;s &quot;danger&quot; flag were shared across the financial system, this <i>would</i> become a serious problem for me. It could freeze me out of online transactions entirely, maybe other things. If landlords had access to paypal&#x27;s &quot;high risk&quot; filter, would it be worth using to filter out bad tenants? Seems possible.<p>The false positive problem goes from an annoyance to a fundamental rights vioation quickly, if data is shared.<p>Insurance is acquiring similar issues, though with very different mechanisms. As statistical inference improves, insurance ceases to be insurance... Risk gets pooled across ever smaller groups. The whole purpose of insurance is to pool risk widely. IMO, this is <i>the</i> problem the US&#x27; health policy architects underestimated. Insurance companies know too much to be insurance companies.<p>More such issues are coming soon.

Most things that should be mocked are already interfaces in my code. My biggest grievances with Go are its limited type system and dependency management. Unlike most[^1], I don&#x27;t need semantic versions--I just need deterministic, reproducible builds, and for that, vendoring is fine in theory, but Go&#x27;s tooling around it needs work.<p>I love that Go is a language that can be <i>mastered</i> in a matter of months; that it has such a simple &quot;get up and running&quot; story; that its tools mostly do the right thing by default; and that almost everything is straightforward.

For the most part, Go just works out of the box.<p>I think folks also underappreciate Go&#x27;s runtime--it has a fast garbage collector and an awesome goroutine scheduler that all get statically compiled into your application binary. Mostly, I want a functional language that <i>compiles to Go</i> so I can still leverage Go&#x27;s awesome tooling, runtime, and deployment model, but with things like generics and algebraic data types. I&#x27;ve started prototyping it too, and so far it&#x27;s coming along smoothly (modulo all the things I&#x27;m learning about building a programming language). On that note, there is some effort going on in the Go community to build a VM for Go, which would probably make an even more attractive compilation target, at least from a toolchain perspective. Even if my project doesn&#x27;t take off (and it likely won&#x27;t), I think this is a low-effort way to address Go&#x27;s most significant complaints.<p>[^1]: Well, &quot;most&quot; judging by the significance many of Go&#x27;s critics place on semantically versioned dependencies","time":1510236524,"type":"comment"}

I have personally had job interview in which the lack of popular social activity outside schools hours resulted in me not getting the job. Every time I see a studying looking at appearance and conformity to social expectations and norms I see a global phenomenon where society rewards conformity and punish non-conformity. Faking conformity is not a solution, but I can&#x27;t say there has been much progress in removing the underlying issue.

There were a study done on parents to cancer sick children, and there were some direct correlation between behavior and stress management. In short summery to what I recall, suppressing the idea that the child was sick gave short-term stress reduction but that had a major price to pay when reality crashed in. Those that accepted reality early and gave themselves some room to exercise control (like making sure someone was in the room, that the nurses read the right bed-night story, and so on) generally faired better in the long run.

This all well-known stuff and employed methodically. There is an interesting article where a Google design ethicist explains how technology hijacks your mind [1].<p>TL;DR:<p>Hijack 1: If You Control the Menu, You Control the Choices. Ask yourself: What’s not on the menu?, Why am I being given these options and not others? Do I know the menu provider’s goals? Is this menu empowering for my original need, or are the choices actually a distraction?<p>Hijack 2: Make apps behave like Slot Machines - give a variable reward. If you want to maximize addictiveness, link a user’s action (like pulling a lever) with a variable reward. You pull a lever and immediately receive either an enticing reward (a match, a prize!) or nothing. Addictiveness is maximized when the rate of reward is most variable.<p>Hijack 3: Fear of Missing Something Important (FOMSI). If I convince you that I’m a channel for important information, messages, friendships, or potential sexual opportunities — it will be hard for you to turn me off, unsubscribe, or remove your account — because there is a 1% chance you could be missing something important.<p>Hijack 4: Social Approval. When you get tagged by my friend, you think s&#x2F;he made a conscious choice to tag you, when actually s&#x2F;he just responds to Facebook’s suggestion, not making an independent choice. Thus Facebook controls the multiplier for how often millions of people experience their social approval on the line.<p>Hijack 5: Social Reciprocity (Tit-for-tat). You follow me — it’s rude not to follow you back. When you receive an invitation from someone to connect, you imagine that person making a conscious choice to invite you, when in reality, they likely unconsciously responded to LinkedIn’s list of suggested c ontacts.<p>Hijack 6: Bottomless bowls, Infinite Feeds, and Autoplay<p>Hijack 7: Instant Interruption vs. “Respectful” Delivery. Messages that interrupt people immediately are more persuasive at getting people to respond than messages delivered asynchronously.<p>Hijack 8: Bundling Your Reasons with Their Reasons. When you you want to look up a Facebook event happening tonight (your reason) the Facebook app doesn’t allow you to access it without first landing on the news feed (their reasons), so Facebook converts every reason you have for using it, into their reason which is to maximize the time you spend consuming things. In an ideal world, apps would always give you a direct way to get what you want separately from what they want.<p>Hijack 9: Inconvenient Choices. Businesses naturally want to make the choices they want you to make easier, and the choices they don’t want you to make harder. NYTimes.com claims to give you “a free choice” to cancel your digital subscription. But instead of just doing it when you hit “Cancel Subscription,” they force you to call a phone number that’s only open at certain times.<p>Hijack 10: Forecasting Errors, “Foot in the Door” strategies. People don’t intuitively forecast the true time cost of a click when it’s presented to them. Sales people use “foot in the door” techniques by asking for a small innocuous request to begin with (“just one click”), and escalating from there (“why don’t you stay awhile?”). Virtually all engagement websites use this trick.<p>===<p>[1] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tristanharris.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;05&#x2F;how-technology-hijacks-peoples-minds%E2%80%8A-%E2%80%8Afrom-a-magician-and-googles-design-ethicist&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tristanharris.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;05&#x2F;how-technology-hijacks-...</a>","time":1510238997,"type":"comment"}

Nobody is complaining about the use of interfaces that declare a useful set of methods, and are meant to be used when the set of methods is all the target code cares about. They may complain about some of the edges around them (no support for contra- or covariance), but that&#x27;s not the complaint that is being discussed here.<p>The complaint is specifically around interface{}, which is a type that means nothing, and so everything fits into it. It means that if you are a function that is receiving an interface{}, you know nothing about the argument to start with, and will have to either pass it along to something else, or examine it via type assertions or in the worst case, the reflect library.<p>As a multi-year Go programmer, I agree that A: the &quot;true&quot; interface{} that is the meaningless type appears less often than people think, and that if you program is shot through with it, you are either working in a domain where Go is not suitable (complicated math processing, IMHO, for instance), <i>or</i> you are programming some other language in Go, and need to learn how to use Go properly, but also, B: it does happen that things that would be well-typed in other languages will have interface{} show up, which means you&#x27;re going to sacrifice runtime safety and some performance, though the exact impact depends on what you are doing.<p>(I say the &quot;true&quot; interface{} because there&#x27;s also some places where interface{} shows up, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt you. For instance, the standard JSON library accepts an interface{} to say what data structure to parse the JSON into, and the code that implements that is somewhat complicated, but for the most part, that interface{} doesn&#x27;t bother <i>you</i>, the Go user. In theory you can encounter run time errors if you pass in something that doesn&#x27;t work, but in practice, if you pass in the same type every time, which is the natural case that is going to result if you just program normally, it&#x27;s not a problem. In general, `interface{}` showing up in the incoming parameters of a library is much less concerning than an interface{} showing up in the return parameters for a library. In the former case, even though the language does not enforce type safety, <i>you</i> can enforce type safety by how you use the method; in the latter, you are stuck with an interface{} in your code with all that implies.)","time":1510239981,"type":"comment"}

The survival of a queen that produces viable progeny is paramount to the survival of the species and, at a more granular level, the bloodline of the individual colony.<p>The queen is dependent on the drones being as obedient as your fingers and tongue might be to your brain, with your brain being the queen organ, for your hundred(s of) pound(s of) tissue. We know that the surface ants support the colony, which supports the queen, and overall, the biomass of the ant colony is less than any single mammal, and we know that any signaling is provoked by scent, based on attack behaviors at a minimum.<p>Meaning that reaction to scent wafts through colonies quickly, engaging behavior as quickly as it is noticed. Ants seem to drop everything, and move, unanimously, when a signal is given. The signals must be pretty complex, with pointers hooked into fixed physical actions on some level. The ants probably don&#x27;t think very much about what they should do next, as much as constantly listen or smell for a prevailing vote on what to do. Attack, forage, assemble into a formation, wait for further instructions, and so on.<p>In ant studies, an ant colony is segmented  into chambers, each having odors, the most conspicuous being the colony&#x27;s waste dump, so you have to figure that the colony survives, and expects the surface soldiers to go permanently missing once in a while, when scent signaling is disrupted.<p>These fungal organisms probably interact with a degree of equilibrium, when exposed to healthy ant colonies. Usually a parasitic relationship with a host is balanced to not completely destroy the host population, according to an almost intuitive self-preservation instinct among parasites. So the fungus probably only disrupts soldiers at the periphery of the colony, without destroying the core of the hill.<p>You can get a sense of this, based on the fact that the affected ants are driven away from the hill, toward environments more opportunistic to the fungus. If a version of the fungus were to grow opportunistically within the colony, it might invade and drive the ants to extinction, which might turn out to be, in effect, suicidal for the fungus too, and not just the ant.<p>The colony is really the organism, and the soldiers serve it, abiding by prevailing odors, likely without very much free will. Or at least as much free will as your arm has, to reflexively recoil from a burn, or lash out at some unassessed threat when reacting in fear.<p>This fungus probably is basically &quot;numbing&quot; the arm, but the wild part of seeing your arm suddenly behave with a mind of its own, would be an observation from the perspective of the queen, and is probably more or less like seeing a junkie or crackhead stumble around like a zombie, as far as the colony-as-organism is concerned.<p>So, if the ant is &quot;fighting&quot; the &quot;will&quot; of the fungus, it&#x27;s probably more likely that the ant is receiving strong scent signals compelling it to act a certain way, and the sauce that the fungus is producing as an override to the biological signals in the ant&#x27;s circulatory system (remembering that insect circulatory systems are primitive, and probably easily hackable fluid systems) might be weak, or the infectious load might be light, resulting in a noisy, conflicted signal at the neurological level. Maybe like a junkie, not completely ruined by dope.<p><i>tl;dr</i> soldier ants follow their nose without a whole lot of agency, because they are born to serve the colony, selflessly. Thus they likely are unconcerned by a &quot;loss of self,&quot; and perhaps might be more emotionally invested in failing the colony, if soldier ants have emotions.","time":1510241330,"type":"comment"}

They get more and more polished on a UI level, and more realistic looking, but remain static mechanically.<p>For example, Skyrim doesn&#x27;t do much mechanically that Ultima Underworld didn&#x27;t. Ultima proper did all of that from a different perspective for a long while before that, too. The Witcher 3 is my absolute favorite RPG at least since Skyrim and probably supercedes it, but again, it&#x27;s just super polished, it doesn&#x27;t do much that&#x27;s really new, that I haven&#x27;t seen before in an RPG or other game. You pick speech options from dialogue trees, loot dead things, and fetch quest items, but you&#x27;re in a cardboard world. The monsters just wait for you to come slaughter them, they&#x27;re set-pieces whose purpose is to sit there until you arrive, then bite you. The world reacts largely in a single specific way: you win.<p>Actually, I thing modern RPGs have regressed, Ultima VI&#x27;s keyword-based dialogue was better than our modern dialogue trees. You could speak in natural language about a variety of topics, some of which were hinted at by the NPC with highlighted words, and others you had to figure out for yourself. (you could just type &quot;troll&quot; or you could type &quot;What can you tell me about the troll?&quot; or &quot;I have seen a troll, and need advice, can you help?&quot;, it was more fun and interactive)<p>I&#x27;m hyped for Underworld Ascendant, because just maybe they&#x27;ll break some new ground for a change. &quot;A living ecosystem&quot;, but with people who can (and have) backed up that claim. I don&#x27;t see much else on the horizon -- the indies are our only hopes! AAA can&#x27;t afford to lose now, so it&#x27;s all cookie cutter sequels there, only the indies can afford the risk.<p>I think a huge, huge part of the problem is that games cost so much and carry so much risk now. Ultima Underworld got a full sequel _ELEVEN MONTHS LATER_. You could move faster and try more then, because art didn&#x27;t cost so much, there was no motion capture, no voice acting, it was cheap to make a game.

It would be a form of direct parasitic control rather than the current indirect parasitic control of the masses by the government&#x2F;elites.<p>But maybe if society and science has advanced to such a level, maybe we won&#x27;t need humans anymore. If our understanding of the brain gets to such a level, organic&#x2F;natural humans who be an evolutionary dead end and we&#x27;ll be producing sentient AI. It seems like AI and brain research goes hand in hand. One informs the other and vice versa. The more we learn about the brain, the more we learn about AI. The more we learn about AI, the more we learn about the brain. Very interesting stuff.","time":1510242084,"type":"comment"}

I think what you&#x27;re referring to is the other packages that define their own Reader&#x27;s, ie using structs with methods, those are referred to as interfaces despite not literally being an interface{}.&quot;<p>That appears to be a definition unique to you that I have never seen from anyone else before, including the Go designers. io.Reader is an interface, no braces. Its full expansion would be interface { Read(p []byte) (n int, err error) }, and it is incorrect to substitute that for interface{} as that is a very different thing. Structs that implement the interface are, well, structs that implement the interface. interface{} is <i>specifically reserved</i> for discussion about the <i>empty</i> interface.<p>For instance, do a browser find for &quot;interface&quot; in <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;golang.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;effective_go.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;golang.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;effective_go.html</a> ; you will find the documentation frequently referring to &quot;interfaces&quot; and that interface{} is reserved for the empty interface.<p>For the final proof of this, note how confusing it is for you to be reading the Go criticism as being about the use of interfaces-in-general in Go. Why would that provoke such a reaction? The answer is that people aren&#x27;t talking about the feature, they are specifically referring to the number of places <i>interface{}</i> appears, the &quot;Any&quot; type, the &quot;I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in there at all&quot; type. It&#x27;s not the use of interfaces in general, it&#x27;s the way that suddenly one goes from a decent enough statically-typed language to a not-all-that-great dynamically-typed language when interface{} appears.

As recently as a few years ago, a stage III diagnosis had around 50-60% 5 year mortality, and a stage IV had a 90% 2 year mortality.  Because melanoma is primarily an immune-system mediated cancer, many of the recent advances with targeted genetics and immune-system stimulation help melanoma patients directly, and the &quot;new&quot; numbers on those cases aren&#x27;t able to be calculated yet simply because enough time hasn&#x27;t passed. But the general consensus is that they&#x27;re going to have to revise those outcome predictions a great deal now that we have these tools available.<p>The question of how many of those treatments are affordable is largely driven by the country they&#x27;re in—many countries regulate the cost of pharma in general, so they&#x27;d be more affordable than in the US.","time":1510244860,"type":"comment"}

I don&#x27;t think this should stop us from creating, but perhaps it would be a good idea to partner with a friend that has marketing talent.<p>Thanks for offering me the opportunity to share here. :) If any of you give WarpSpeed a try, please let me know what you think.","time":1510245447,"type":"comment"}

Have you played The Witcher 3? Life is Strange? Until Dawn? They are games with heavy narrative where your choices impact the direction of the story (in Until Dawn, any and all of the 8 characters can die or survive, depending on your choices). Or games like Bloodborne or Dark Souls, which, at first glance, are just action games, but when you look beneath the surface, they hide extremely rich and deep storylines (but its up to you to dig for it if you so wish) and incredible environmental storytelling. Or a game like Machinarium, which manages to tell its story purely through pictures. Or The Last of Us, which, while its a 3D action game (kind of), is the first game that, for me, surpassed movies in atmosphere, storytelling and getting me emotionally invested in the characters.<p>My point is that games have moved on and there are a lot of games out there that aren&#x27;t <i>&quot;3D action with no substance&quot;</i>. A lot of indie games aren&#x27;t even 3D or action. There&#x27;s a vast spectrum of games out there, I bet there&#x27;s plenty that you would, in fact, enjoy.<p>&gt; I for one would be very happy to see the return of this style of gaming<p>I used to play MUD&#x27;s back in the day and even worked on my own MUD engine a few times.
